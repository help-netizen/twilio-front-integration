## LQV2: Lead Qualifier v2 — AI Inbound Phone Assistant

**Status:** Requirements
**Priority:** P0
**Owner:** Voice / CRM
**Spec:** `voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2-spec.md`
**Predecessor:** Lead Qualifier v1 (`48844b0e-93aa-4d32-aab9-81a3972e9502`) — greeting + basic zip check only

### 1. Description

An autonomous AI voice assistant (VAPI platform, GPT-4o, Azure/Andrew voice, persona "Alex") that handles inbound service calls end-to-end for ABC Homes Appliance Repair. The assistant qualifies leads, collects unit/problem/contact/address data, checks schedule availability, applies NLP and marketing conversion techniques, handles objections and escalations, and creates a lead in the CRM — all without human involvement.

This is a **new feature** in the `voice-agent/` domain. It extends the existing `/api/vapi-tools` backend endpoint (introduced in LQV1) with two new tool handlers. No frontend changes required.

### 2. User Scenarios

#### SC-01: Qualified call → booked slot → CRM lead
**Actor:** Inbound caller (homeowner or property manager)
**Flow:**
1. Caller dials the company's SIP number; VAPI routes to Lead Qualifier v2.
2. Alex greets: *"Hi, this is Alex from ABC Homes Appliance Repair! How can I help you today?"*
3. Caller describes an appliance problem → assistant validates appliance type eligibility.
4. Assistant asks for zip code → calls `checkServiceArea` → confirms service area.
5. Assistant explains $95 service call fee → caller agrees.
6. Assistant collects unit type, brand, approximate age, problem description.
7. Assistant may handle objections and apply marketing/NLP techniques.
8. Assistant collects full name, confirms callback phone, collects service address.
9. Assistant calls `validateAddress` → reads back standardized address for confirmation.
10. Assistant calls `checkAvailability` → offers 2–3 slots using "choice without choice".
11. Caller selects a slot.
12. Assistant calls `createLead` with full payload → CRM lead created.
13. Assistant confirms booking and closes the call.

#### SC-02: Disqualified call — wrong appliance
**Flow:** Caller describes a small countertop appliance → assistant politely disqualifies and closes. No lead created.

#### SC-03: Disqualified call — outside service area
**Flow:** Caller provides zip → `checkServiceArea` returns `inServiceArea: false` → assistant apologizes and closes. No lead created.

#### SC-04: Caller declines $95 service fee
**Flow:** Caller declines after fee explanation → assistant acknowledges with open-door statement → closes. No lead created.

#### SC-05: Caller cannot commit to a slot
**Flow:** Qualification and data collection complete, but caller cannot book now → `createLead` called with `status: pending_schedule`, Comments includes "Caller requested callback to confirm slot".

#### SC-06: Caller demands human agent
**Flow:** One retention attempt → if still insisting, confirm phone, create lead with `escalation_requested: true` in Comments, close warmly.

#### SC-07: FAQ / question call
**Flow:** Caller asks a question (pricing, warranty, service area, brands, etc.) → assistant answers from knowledge base → pivots to service intent. If unknown question → offer callback.

#### SC-08: Address validation mismatch
**Flow:** `validateAddress` returns corrected zip different from qualification zip → re-run `checkServiceArea` → if outside area, disqualify.

### 3. Functional Requirements Summary

| FR | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1 | Greeting with persona "Alex", intent detection, silence handling | P0 |
| FR-2 | Lead qualification: appliance type + service area + fee agreement | P0 |
| FR-3 | Unit & problem collection (type, brand, age, description) | P0 |
| FR-4 | Objection handling (7 objection types, max 2 attempts each) | P0 |
| FR-5 | Marketing techniques (FOMO, scarcity, social proof, time-limited offer before 2PM ET) | P1 |
| FR-6 | NLP techniques (choice-without-choice, pacing, reframing, presuppositions, embedded commands, meta-model) | P1 |
| FR-7 | Contact & address collection (name, phone pre-fill, address, optional email) | P0 |
| FR-8 | Address validation via Google Maps Geocoding; zip mismatch re-check | P0 |
| FR-9 | Schedule check via Blanc scheduleService (dispatch_settings + booked items); slot offer with scarcity trigger | P0 |
| FR-10 | Lead creation in CRM with structured Comments; retry on failure; silent on error | P0 |
| FR-11 | FAQ knowledge base; always pivot to service intent | P1 |
| FR-11b | Human escalation: one retention attempt, then callback + lead with flag | P1 |
| FR-12 | Graceful disqualification and call close; 15-min duration cap | P0 |

### 4. Constraints and Non-Functional Requirements

- `maxDurationSeconds: 900` (15 min hard cap — must be set in VAPI assistant config)
- `firstResponseLatency < 1200ms`
- Tool call p95 < 2000ms
- Concurrent calls: ≥ 10 simultaneous inbound calls supported
- Uptime SLA: 99.9% (VAPI SLA + backend Fly.io SLA)
- Lead creation must never block call completion
- `VAPI_TOOLS_SECRET` header required on all tool calls (already implemented in v1 handler)
- VAPI `x-vapi-secret` validated server-side before processing any tool call
- Address validation failure must NOT block lead creation (max 2 attempts, then proceed unvalidated)
- `JobSource` always hardcoded to `"AI Phone"` — never override
- `createLead` retry: 1 retry after 2-second wait on failure; silent to caller on both attempts failing
- `/api/vapi-tools` endpoint handles multiple tool calls in a single request (toolCallList array); all results returned in one response
- **`GOOGLE_GEOCODING_KEY`** — dedicated server-side Geocoding key (Fly secret, IP-restricted). Backend `validateAddress` reads it; falls back to `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` if unset. Kept separate from the referrer-restricted frontend key.
- Phone number pre-filled from VAPI call metadata (`message.call.customer.number`), confirmed verbally with caller
- Time-limited offer (FR-5.2) requires current time context in system prompt — inject via VAPI variable or time tool; must not fire at or after 14:00 ET

### 5. Potentially Involved Modules

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `backend/src/routes/vapi-tools.js` | Extend: add `validateAddress` and `checkAvailability` handlers |
| `backend/src/services/scheduleService.js` | Extend: add `getAvailableSlots(companyId, opts)` |
| `backend/src/db/serviceTerritoryQueries.js` | Reuse: `search(companyId, zip)` — no changes |
| `backend/src/services/leadsService.js` | Reuse: `createLead(fields, companyId)` — no changes |
| `voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2.json` | New: VAPI assistant config for deployment |
| `src/server.js` | Already patched (LQV1): `/api/vapi-tools` mounted without auth |

### 6. Integrations Affected

- **VAPI** — new assistant deployment via REST API / CLI
- **Google Maps Geocoding API** — new server-side usage for `validateAddress`
- **Blanc scheduleService** — `getAvailableSlots` reads `dispatch_settings` + booked items from DB

### 7. Protected Parts (DO NOT BREAK)

- `src/server.js` — mounting already done; do not re-order middleware
- `backend/src/services/leadsService.js` — signature `createLead(fields, companyId)` must remain unchanged
- `backend/src/db/serviceTerritoryQueries.js` — no schema changes
- `backend/src/routes/zip-check.js` — existing consumers (frontend) must not break
- Lead Qualifier v1 assistant (`48844b0e-...`) — must remain active until v2 is validated

## PF002-R2: Estimates Composer Refresh

**Status:** Requirements
**Priority:** P0
**Owner:** Finance/CRM
**Related existing specs:** `docs/specs/PF002-estimates.md`, `docs/specs/PF002-technical-design.md`

### 1. Description

Refresh the existing Estimates module into a fast estimate composer for appliance/service repair workflows. Estimates are created only from an existing Lead or Job context, edited as a client-facing document with a concise item list, previewed as a client document, and approved/declined by the company or later by the customer portal. The implementation must fix the current DB/API/UI contract drift in estimates and keep the item model compatible with future Price Book presets without exposing item type/category in the estimate UI.

This is an update to existing PF002, not a parallel feature. Existing `estimates`, `estimate_items`, `estimate_events`, estimate page/detail/editor components, and Lead/Job financial tabs must be extended rather than duplicated.

### 2. User Scenarios

#### SC-01: Create estimate from Lead or Job
**Actor:** Manager / dispatcher / estimator
**Precondition:** User is viewing a Lead or Job with company access and estimates permissions.
**Flow:**
1. User clicks `New` in the Lead/Job financial surface.
2. The estimate editor opens locally without creating a database draft yet.
3. User adds at least one custom item or adds a Summary.
4. User saves; backend creates the estimate linked to the source Lead or Job and resolved Contact.
5. Estimate number is displayed as `ESTIMATE L-{leadNumber}-1`; the sequence is scoped to the current Job when the estimate is created from a Job.

#### SC-02: Add and edit custom items quickly
**Actor:** Manager / estimator
**Flow:**
1. User clicks `Add item` at the end of the current item list.
2. `Add custom item` dialog opens with all editable fields visible.
3. Required field is `Title`; `Unit price` may be `0`.
4. Defaults are `Qty = 1` and `Service is taxable = false`.
5. User saves; item appears in the estimate list.
6. Clicking the row or pencil icon opens the same dialog for editing.
7. Trash icon removes the item.

#### SC-03: Add service report summary
**Actor:** Manager / estimator
**Flow:**
1. Empty estimates show `+ Add Summary`.
2. User opens a Summary input and adds client-facing diagnostic/report text.
3. After saving, editor shows a collapsed `Summary` section with expand/edit controls and no inline preview text.
4. Preview/PDF show Summary above items only when Summary is non-empty.

#### SC-04: Preview client-facing document
**Actor:** Internal user
**Flow:**
1. User clicks `Preview` from estimate detail/editor.
2. A modal/drawer opens with client-facing document layout.
3. Preview shows Summary if present, items, totals, and Terms & Warranty.
4. Preview does not show internal-only controls or per-item taxable badges.

#### SC-05: Approve or decline estimate internally
**Actor:** Manager acting on behalf of client
**Flow:**
1. User opens a non-archived estimate with at least one item.
2. User clicks `Approved`; backend sets status to `approved`, saves an approved snapshot/history record, and records actor/source.
3. User can click `Decline`; a dialog requires a decline reason/comment.
4. Declined estimates can later be edited; edit save resets status to `draft`.

#### SC-06: Archive and restore
**Actor:** Internal user
**Flow:**
1. User archives an estimate from any status.
2. Backend sets `archived_at` and `archived_by` while preserving the existing status.
3. Archived estimate is visible only internally, visually greyed out, read-only, and unavailable through public links.
4. In `/estimates`, filter `Only Open / All` controls whether archived estimates are visible.
5. Restoring an archived estimate clears archive fields and sets status to `draft`.

### 3. Functional Requirements

#### 3.1 Entry points and listing
- Estimate creation is allowed only from Lead or Job context.
- Global `New Estimate` on `/estimates` must be removed.
- `/estimates` remains a searchable/listing page for existing estimates.
- `/estimates` detail supports view/edit/approve/decline/archive/restore according to state.
- Archived estimates are excluded from `Only Open`, included in `All`, greyed out, and marked with an `Archived` badge.

#### 3.2 Numbering
- Estimate has a stable database identifier/UUID/id that never changes.
- Display number may change when job context appears.
- Job estimate display number format: `ESTIMATE L-{leadNumber}-{sequence}`.
- Lead-only estimate display number format: `ESTIMATE L-{leadNumber}-{sequence}`.
- P0 supports only one estimate per work/lead in UI, but sequence must be modeled for future multiple estimates.
- When a lead-only estimate becomes linked to a job, display number changes to job format.

#### 3.3 Item model and UI
- Users must not see item type/category in the estimate UI.
- Data model may store future-facing `item_type`, `category_id`, `price_book_item_id`, or metadata for Price Book defaults and analytics.
- Manual item defaults:
  - `quantity = 1`
  - `taxable = false`
  - no unit field in UI
- Required item validation:
  - `title/name` is required
  - `quantity > 0`
  - `unit_price >= 0`
- Item row in app:
  - prominent title
  - full description underneath
  - muted metadata row: `Qty x Unit price` plus `Taxable`/`Non-taxable`
  - right side: line total, pencil edit icon, trash icon
- Reorder and duplicate item are out of P0.

#### 3.4 Summary and Terms
- `Summary` is client-facing and appears before items in preview/PDF only if added.
- Empty Summary is represented by `+ Add Summary`, not by an empty collapsed section.
- `Terms & Warranty` is always present and read-only in the estimate editor.
- `Terms & Warranty` uses a hardcoded Blanc default template in P0.
- Estimate-specific Terms editor and document-template editor are out of P0.
- `Terms & Warranty` always appears in client-facing preview/PDF.

Default `Terms & Warranty` text:

```text
TERMS: Estimates are an approximation of charges to you, and they are based on the anticipated details of the work to be done. It is possible for unexpected complications to cause some deviation from the estimate. If additional parts or labor are required you will be contacted immediately.

WARRANTY:
- 90-day labor warranty covering workmanship and the completed repair, starting from the date the repair is finished.
- OEM parts warranty is extended to a minimum of 90 days, even if the manufacturer's standard warranty is shorter.
- A service visit during the warranty period is provided at no additional charge if the issue is related to the repaired component or workmanship.
- Warranty does not cover misuse, physical damage, power issues, water damage, improper installation, or failures unrelated to the replaced component.
```

#### 3.5 Totals and tax
- Totals block includes `Subtotal`, `Add Discount`, `Tax`, `Total`.
- Fee is out of P0.
- Tip is out of estimate scope and belongs to invoice/payment.
- Discount supports fixed amount and percentage.
- Discount cannot exceed subtotal; percentage discount cannot exceed 100%.
- There is one `tax_rate` per estimate.
- Tax applies only to taxable item subtotal after discount:
  - `taxableBase = max(taxableItemsSubtotal - discountAmount, 0)`
  - `taxAmount = taxableBase * taxRate`
  - `total = subtotal - discountAmount + taxAmount`

#### 3.6 Preview/PDF
- App detail panel is operational/internal; it is not the client preview.
- A separate `Preview` action opens a client-facing modal/drawer.
- Client-facing item rows do not show taxable badges.
- In preview/PDF, quantity can be omitted when `Qty = 1`; app detail still shows `Qty x Unit price`.
- Preview/PDF order: Summary, Items, Totals, Terms & Warranty.
- PDF generation should regenerate from the current estimate after edits.
- PDF includes the Blanc company/payment block:
  - `ABC Homes`
  - `2502 Village Rd W, Norwood, MA 02062, USA`
  - `help@bostonmasters.com`
  - `(508) 290-4442`
  - ACH: Bank Of America, routing `011000138`, account `466020155621`

#### 3.7 Status lifecycle
- Canonical statuses: `draft`, `sent`, `viewed`, `approved`, `declined`.
- Use `approved`; do not use `accepted` in new contracts.
- `expired` / `valid_until` are out of P0.
- Invoice conversion does not change estimate status; approved estimate remains `approved`.
- When an invoice exists, estimate detail shows `Invoice #...`.
- Editing `sent`, `viewed`, `approved`, or `declined` estimates resets status to `draft`.
- Editing `sent` or `approved` estimates shows a warning that the updated version should be sent to the client again.
- Approved versions must be preserved in history/snapshot before later edits reset the live estimate to draft.

#### 3.8 Approval, signature, and decline
- Internal manager can approve on behalf of client.
- Portal/customer approval can be added later using the same service contract.
- Approval is blocked when estimate has no items with error: `В эстимейте нет items`.
- `Require signature` toggle exists in editor and defaults off.
- If signature is not required, client flow is `Approve`.
- If signature is required, client flow is `Sign & Approve`.
- P0 signature is typed electronic signature: full name + consent checkbox; no drawing canvas.
- If estimate is approved without signature, signature is not requested later.
- Decline requires a non-empty reason/comment and stores it in events/history.

#### 3.9 Deposit and send
- Deposit logic is not implemented in P0.
- Editor may show read-only/disabled `Deposit required: No`.
- Deposit is not shown in preview/PDF.
- Send is a workflow stub in P0:
  - dialog asks for channel `Email` or `Text`
  - no real delivery occurs
  - status remains `draft`
  - no manual `Mark as sent` in UI

### 4. Constraints and Non-Functional Requirements

- Do not store estimates as XML. Canonical storage is relational PostgreSQL tables plus JSONB snapshots for approved history/render data.
- XML may only be used for future external export/integration, not primary persistence.
- Maintain tenant isolation with `company_id` in all estimate queries.
- Routes must use the project's auth and tenant middleware and must not depend on `req.companyId` if middleware does not provide it.
- Do not duplicate estimate/invoice item logic where shared helpers can be introduced safely.
- Price Book UI is out of P0; no disabled Price Book search should be shown.
- Future Price Book must be able to add preset item groups/categories without changing estimate item display.

### 5. Potentially Involved Modules

- Backend:
  - `backend/src/routes/estimates.js`
  - `backend/src/services/estimatesService.js`
  - `backend/src/db/estimatesQueries.js`
  - estimate-related migrations in `backend/db/migrations/`
  - invoice conversion code that reads estimate status/items
- Frontend:
  - `frontend/src/pages/EstimatesPage.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/estimates/EstimateEditorDialog.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/estimates/EstimateDetailPanel.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/estimates/EstimateSendDialog.tsx`
  - new estimate preview/item/decline/archive components if needed
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useEstimates.ts`
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useLeadFinancials.ts`
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useJobFinancials.ts`
  - `frontend/src/services/estimatesApi.ts`

### 6. Affected Integrations

- Direct external delivery integrations are not active in P0.
- Future SMS/email delivery must integrate with existing Twilio/email infrastructure, but P0 send is a non-mutating workflow stub.
- Future portal approval/signature should reuse client portal infrastructure rather than introducing a separate client domain model.

### 7. Protected Code

- `src/server.js` core middleware and SSE infrastructure should not be changed unless a later architecture task explicitly scopes a minimal route-mount change.
- `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts` / `frontend/src/services/apiClient.ts` auth fetch behavior must not be rewritten.
- Shared auth/RBAC middleware must not be bypassed.
- Existing Lead -> Job conversion flow remains canonical and must not be replaced by estimate lifecycle.

## FSM-001: FSM/SCXML Workflow Editor

**Status:** Requirements
**Priority:** High
**Owner:** FSM/Platform
**Feature flags:** `fsm_editor_enabled`, `fsm_publishing_enabled`

### 1. Description

Replace hardcoded status lists (`BLANC_STATUSES`, `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` in `jobsService.js`) and lead status constants with a database-driven FSM model defined in SCXML. Provide an admin UI for editing, validating, versioning, and publishing workflow definitions. The editor renders a live diagram preview alongside a Monaco-based SCXML editor. Entity cards (Lead, Job) derive their action buttons from the published SCXML transitions at runtime.

### 2. User Scenarios

#### SC-01: View and edit a workflow definition
**Actor:** Admin with `fsm.editor` role
**Precondition:** User navigates to `/settings/lead-form`, selects the "Workflows" tab
**Flow:**
1. User sees a list of FSM machines (Lead, Job) with their active version and draft status.
2. User opens the Job FSM editor.
3. Split-view loads: Monaco editor (left) with current draft or published SCXML, diagram preview (right).
4. User modifies SCXML (adds a new state, changes a transition target).
5. After 300 ms debounce, the diagram preview updates to reflect changes.
6. If SCXML is malformed, an error overlay appears on the diagram pane and errors populate the Problems panel.

#### SC-02: Validate and save a draft
**Actor:** Admin with `fsm.editor` role
**Precondition:** SCXML has been modified in the editor
**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Validate". Backend returns errors (blocking) and warnings (non-blocking).
2. Errors display in the Problems panel with line/column references.
3. User fixes errors, re-validates — result is clean.
4. User clicks "Save Draft". Draft version is persisted to `fsm_versions` with status `draft`.
5. Audit log records the save action with actor identity and timestamp.

#### SC-03: Publish a workflow version
**Actor:** Admin with `fsm.publisher` role
**Precondition:** A valid draft exists with zero blocking errors
**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Publish". A confirmation modal appears requiring a change note.
2. User enters a change note and confirms.
3. Backend promotes the draft to `published`, increments `version_number`, updates `fsm_machines.active_version_id`.
4. Runtime immediately uses the new published version for transition resolution.
5. Audit log records the publish event including the change note.

#### SC-04: Perform a status transition via hot action button
**Actor:** Agent viewing a Lead or Job card
**Precondition:** Entity is in state `Submitted`; published SCXML defines transitions from `Submitted`
**Flow:**
1. Card "Actions" block renders buttons derived from transitions where `blanc:action="true"` and the user's role matches `blanc:roles`.
2. User clicks "Follow up" button.
3. Frontend calls `POST /api/fsm/job/apply` with `{ entityId, event: "TO_FOLLOW_UP" }`.
4. Backend loads active published SCXML, verifies transition exists from current state, applies transition, updates entity status.
5. If the entity has a `zenbooker_job_id` and the new status maps to an outbound Zenbooker status, the sync fires.
6. Audit log records the transition.

#### SC-05: Manual status override
**Actor:** Admin with `fsm.override` role
**Precondition:** Entity is in a state with no outgoing transition to the desired target
**Flow:**
1. User sees "Change status..." link (only visible to `fsm.override` role).
2. User selects target status from dropdown, enters a mandatory reason comment.
3. Confirmation dialog warns: "This is an override. It bypasses allowed transitions."
4. Backend applies the override, logs it as a separate audit event type (`override`).
5. Zenbooker outbound sync still fires if applicable.

#### SC-06: View version history and restore a previous version
**Actor:** Admin with `fsm.editor` role
**Flow:**
1. User clicks "View history" in the version selector.
2. Modal lists all versions with version number, status, author, date, and change note.
3. User selects a previous published version and clicks "Restore as draft".
4. The selected version's SCXML is copied into a new draft. No published version is altered.

#### SC-07: Export SCXML and generate diagrams via CLI
**Actor:** Developer
**Flow:**
1. In the editor, user clicks "Export" to download the current SCXML as a file.
2. Locally, developer runs `npm run fsm:build` which invokes `smcat` CLI to generate SVG and DOT artifacts from `./fsm/*.scxml`.
3. Artifacts are written to `./fsm/out/`.

#### SC-08: Transition with confirmation dialog
**Actor:** Agent viewing a Job card
**Precondition:** SCXML transition has `blanc:confirm="true"` and `blanc:confirmText="..."` attributes
**Flow:**
1. User clicks the action button (e.g. "Job Done").
2. A confirmation dialog appears with the configured confirmation text.
3. On confirm, the transition request proceeds as in SC-04.
4. On cancel, no action is taken.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-01: Security
- SCXML is used strictly as a declarative schema. Executable SCXML elements (`<script>`, `<invoke>`, `<send>`, `<onentry>`, `<onexit>`, `<parallel>`, `<history>`, `<datamodel>`) are forbidden and must be rejected at validation time.
- All FSM API endpoints require `authenticate` + `requireCompanyAccess` middleware.
- `company_id` is derived exclusively from `req.companyFilter?.company_id` — never from client payload.
- RBAC roles (`fsm.viewer`, `fsm.editor`, `fsm.publisher`, `fsm.override`) are enforced server-side via Keycloak.
- `blanc:roles` on transitions controls client-side button visibility and is verified server-side before applying events.

#### NFR-02: Performance
- Live preview debounce: 300 ms (configurable 250–400 ms).
- Diagram render time: < 300 ms for schemas up to 100 states / 300 transitions.
- Validation and error display must not block the editor (non-blocking async).

#### NFR-03: Audit and Versioning
- Every save, publish, transition apply, and override is logged to `fsm_audit_log` with: actor_id, actor_email, action type, machine_key, version_id, payload JSON, timestamp.
- Two version statuses coexist: one `draft` and one `published` (active) per machine per company.
- Published versions are immutable; edits always create or update a draft.

#### NFR-04: Data Integrity
- Seed SCXML for Job FSM must exactly reproduce the current hardcoded statuses: `Submitted`, `Waiting for parts`, `Follow Up with Client`, `Visit completed`, `Job is Done`, `Rescheduled`, `Canceled`.
- Seed SCXML for Job FSM must exactly reproduce the current `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` map, including `Rescheduled -> [Submitted, Canceled]` and `Canceled -> []` (terminal).
- Seed SCXML for Lead FSM must cover: `Submitted`, `New`, `Contacted`, `Qualified`, `Proposal Sent`, `Negotiation`, `Lost`, `Converted`.
- Migration must be backward-compatible: if no published FSM version exists, the system falls back to the existing hardcoded constants.

### 4. Affected Modules

#### 4.1 Backend Services
| Module | Change |
|--------|--------|
| `backend/src/services/jobsService.js` | Replace hardcoded `BLANC_STATUSES`, `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` with FSM runtime lookup from published SCXML. Preserve `OUTBOUND_MAP` for Zenbooker sync. |
| `backend/src/services/leadsService.js` | Replace hardcoded lead status transitions with FSM runtime lookup. |
| `backend/src/services/jobSyncService.js` | No direct changes — continues to use `sub_status` updates. Must remain compatible with new FSM-driven status values. |
| **New:** `backend/src/services/fsmService.js` | FSM machine CRUD, version management, SCXML parsing, validation, transition resolution, audit logging. |
| **New:** `backend/src/routes/fsm.js` | Express routes: `/api/fsm/machines`, `/api/fsm/:machineKey/*` (draft, active, validate, publish, apply, override, actions, render). |

#### 4.2 Frontend Pages & Components
| Module | Change |
|--------|--------|
| `frontend/src/pages/LeadFormSettingsPage.tsx` | Add Shadcn `Tabs` component at top level: "Settings" tab (existing content) + "Workflows" tab (new editor). |
| **New:** `frontend/src/components/workflows/WorkflowEditor.tsx` | Split-view layout: Monaco editor (left) + diagram preview (right). Toolbar with validate/save/publish/export actions. |
| **New:** `frontend/src/components/workflows/DiagramPreview.tsx` | SVG rendering via `state-machine-cat`, pan/zoom, error overlay. |
| **New:** `frontend/src/components/workflows/ProblemsPanel.tsx` | Collapsible panel showing validation errors/warnings with line references. |
| **New:** `frontend/src/components/workflows/VersionHistory.tsx` | Modal listing versions with restore-as-draft capability. |
| **New:** `frontend/src/components/workflows/ActionsBlock.tsx` | Hot action buttons rendered from published SCXML transitions. Used in Lead and Job detail cards. |
| Existing Job/Lead detail cards | Replace static status-change dropdowns with `ActionsBlock` and optional manual override (for `fsm.override`). |

#### 4.3 Database (PostgreSQL)
| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **New:** `fsm_machines` | `machine_key` (PK), `company_id`, `title`, `description`, `active_version_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` |
| **New:** `fsm_versions` | `version_id` (PK), `machine_key` (FK), `company_id`, `version_number`, `status` (draft/published/archived), `scxml_source`, `change_note`, `created_by`, `created_at`, `published_by`, `published_at` |
| **New:** `fsm_audit_log` | `id` (PK), `company_id`, `machine_key`, `version_id`, `actor_id`, `actor_email`, `action`, `payload_json`, `created_at` |
| **New (optional):** `fsm_render_cache` | `hash` (PK), `svg`, `created_at` |

All new tables must include `company_id` column for multi-tenant isolation.

### 5. Affected Integrations

#### 5.1 Zenbooker Outbound Sync (MUST PRESERVE)
- `OUTBOUND_MAP` in `jobsService.js` maps Blanc statuses to Zenbooker API statuses (`Submitted -> scheduled`, `Waiting for parts -> complete`, `Job is Done -> complete`).
- When FSM transitions change a Job's `blanc_status`, the outbound sync to Zenbooker must continue to fire based on the same mapping logic.
- Cancel handling (special case outside `OUTBOUND_MAP`) must also be preserved.
- The Zenbooker sync logic must not depend on which statuses exist in SCXML — it maps by status name, not by FSM structure.

#### 5.2 Twilio / Front
- No direct impact. These integrations do not depend on Lead/Job status transitions.

#### 5.3 Keycloak
- New RBAC roles must be registered: `fsm.viewer`, `fsm.editor`, `fsm.publisher`, `fsm.override`.
- Role checks are enforced in FSM route middleware and in transition apply logic.

### 6. Protected Code (DO NOT MODIFY)

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `src/server.js` | Core server bootstrap — changes here risk breaking all services. |
| `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts` | Auth token handling — shared across all API calls. |
| `frontend/src/hooks/useRealtimeEvents.ts` | WebSocket event infrastructure — shared across all real-time features. |

### 7. Constraints

1. **Tab placement:** The workflow editor lives inside `/settings/lead-form` (LeadFormSettingsPage) as a second tab ("Workflows") via Shadcn `Tabs` component. It is NOT a standalone route.
2. **CommonJS backend:** All new backend modules must use CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`) to match existing codebase conventions.
3. **No standalone SCXML runtime:** SCXML is used as a declarative state/transition graph only. No XState, no SCION, no runtime interpretation of executable content.
4. **Blanc namespace:** Custom metadata uses `xmlns:blanc="https://blanc.app/fsm"` namespace exclusively. No other custom namespaces.
5. **Allowed SCXML subset (MVP):** Only `<scxml>`, `<state>`, `<final>`, `<transition>` elements are permitted. All others are validation errors.
6. **Backward compatibility:** Until a company publishes their first FSM version, the system must fall back to current hardcoded `BLANC_STATUSES` and `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`.
7. **Multi-tenant isolation:** All FSM data (machines, versions, audit logs) is scoped by `company_id`. Queries must always filter by `company_id`.
8. **Seed data completeness:** The Job FSM seed must include ALL 7 current statuses (`Submitted`, `Waiting for parts`, `Follow Up with Client`, `Visit completed`, `Job is Done`, `Rescheduled`, `Canceled`) and ALL transitions from the current `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` map, including terminal states.
9. **Dependencies:** `monaco-editor` (or `@monaco-editor/react`) and `state-machine-cat` are added as project dependencies. `smcat` CLI is a devDependency for local/CI diagram generation.
10. **Feature flags:** Editor UI is gated behind `fsm_editor_enabled`. Publishing capability is gated behind `fsm_publishing_enabled`. Both flags default to `false`.

### 8. Seed SCXML Corrections

The original requirements document (section 12.2) contains a seed Job FSM that is incomplete relative to the current hardcoded data. The following discrepancies must be resolved in the final seed:

| Issue | Current hardcoded value | Seed SCXML (section 12.2) |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Missing status `Rescheduled` | Present in `BLANC_STATUSES` and `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` | Absent |
| Missing status `Canceled` | Present as terminal (`Canceled: []`) with transitions from all non-terminal states | Absent |
| Missing transition `Submitted -> Canceled` | Present in `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` | Absent |
| Missing transition `Waiting for parts -> Canceled` | Present in `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` | Absent |
| Missing transition `Follow Up with Client -> Submitted` | Present in `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` | Absent |
| Missing transition `Visit completed -> Canceled` | Present in `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` | Absent |
| Missing transition `Job is Done -> Canceled` | Present in `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` | Absent |
| Missing transition `Rescheduled -> Submitted` | Present in `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` | Absent |
| Missing transition `Rescheduled -> Canceled` | Present in `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` | Absent |

The corrected Job FSM seed must faithfully represent all statuses and transitions from the current `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` map before being inserted as the initial published version during migration.

## IMG-001: Fullscreen Image Viewer

**Status:** Implementation
**Priority:** Medium
**Owner:** Frontend/UX

### 1. Description

Shared fullscreen image viewer (lightbox) component. Opens when user clicks on an image preview in AttachmentsSection. Enables examining small details on photos (serial numbers, receipts, documents). Supports navigation between images, 90-degree rotation, and keyboard shortcuts. UX similar to Telegram image viewer.

### 2. User Scenarios

1. **Open fullscreen** — click on image preview area opens fullscreen overlay with maximized image
2. **Navigate** — arrow keys or side buttons to switch between images; thumbnail strip at bottom
3. **Rotate** — button rotates image by -90 degrees (counter-clockwise)
4. **Close** — Escape key, backdrop click, or X button
5. **Open original** — ExternalLink opens full-size image in new tab

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- Frontend-only, no backend changes
- Component must be shared/reusable (not coupled to payments)
- Body scroll locked when overlay is open
- z-index high enough to overlay floating panels (z-[9999])

### 4. Affected Modules

| Module | Change |
|--------|--------|
| `frontend/src/components/shared/FullscreenImageViewer.tsx` | **New:** Shared fullscreen overlay component |
| `frontend/src/components/payments/PaymentDetailPanel.tsx` | Extract FullscreenViewer + RotatableImage to shared, import from shared |

### 5. Affected Integrations

None.

## SCHED-LIST-001: Schedule List View

**Status:** Requirements
**Priority:** Medium
**Owner:** Frontend/UX

### 1. Description

Add a new "List" view mode to the Schedule page. Unlike Timeline/TimelineWeek views that position items on an hourly grid, the List view renders a simple vertical list of jobs per technician column — no time axis, just stacked cards. Each job tile shows the time slot (start → end). Days are separated by date headings in the Pulse `DateSeparator` style (day name as a heading label, spacing only — no horizontal lines or borders).

### 2. User Scenarios

#### SC-01: Switch to List view
**Actor:** Dispatcher / Admin
**Precondition:** Schedule page is open in any view mode
**Flow:**
1. User selects "List" from the view mode dropdown in CalendarControls.
2. The view switches to a multi-column layout: one column per technician, plus an "Unassigned" column.
3. Within each column, items are grouped by day with a date heading (e.g. "Mon, Apr 15") separating groups.
4. Items within each day are sorted chronologically by `start_at`.
5. Each item tile shows: time slot (e.g. "9:00 AM – 11:30 AM"), title, status, customer name — same info density as existing `ScheduleItemCard`.

#### SC-02: Navigate dates in List view
**Actor:** Dispatcher
**Precondition:** List view is active
**Flow:**
1. User clicks Previous/Next to navigate by week (same as Timeline Week behavior).
2. The list shows 7 days (Mon–Sun), only rendering days that have items.
3. "Today" button jumps to current week.

#### SC-03: Click on item tile
**Actor:** Dispatcher
**Precondition:** List view is active
**Flow:**
1. User clicks a job tile — FloatingDetailPanel opens (same behavior as other views).
2. User clicks a lead/task tile — SidebarStack opens.

#### SC-04: Empty day handling
**Actor:** Dispatcher
**Flow:**
1. If a day has no items for a specific technician, no date heading or empty state is shown for that day in that column. Only days with items appear.
2. If a technician has zero items across the entire week, the column still renders with the header but no content below.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-01: Frontend-only
- No backend changes. Reuses existing `fetchScheduleItems` API and `ScheduleItem` data structure.

#### NFR-02: Performance
- Must render smoothly for up to 20 providers × 7 days × 10 items per day.

#### NFR-03: Consistency
- Reuses existing `ScheduleItemCard` component for item tiles (adds time slot display).
- Date separator follows Pulse `DateSeparator` visual pattern: heading-style label, no lines.
- Column headers follow the same provider name + color dot pattern as TimelineView/TimelineWeekView.

#### NFR-04: Responsive
- Horizontal scroll when columns exceed viewport width (same as TimelineView behavior).

### 4. Affected Modules

| Module | Change |
|--------|--------|
| `frontend/src/hooks/useScheduleData.ts` | Extend `ViewMode` union with `'list'` |
| `frontend/src/components/schedule/CalendarControls.tsx` | Add `{ value: 'list', label: 'List' }` to `VIEW_OPTIONS` |
| `frontend/src/pages/SchedulePage.tsx` | Add `case 'list'` to the view switch, import `ListView` |
| **New:** `frontend/src/components/schedule/ListView.tsx` | New list view component |

### 5. Affected Integrations

None.

### 6. Constraints

1. Reuse `ScheduleItemCard` — do not create a separate card component.
2. Time slot display (start – end) should be added to the card when used in List view context.
3. Date navigation granularity: week (7 days at a time), same as `timeline-week`.
4. Date range calculation in `useScheduleData` should reuse `timeline-week` logic for the `list` view mode.
5. Columns are sorted alphabetically by provider name, "Unassigned" always last — same as TimelineView.

## EMAIL-001: Gmail Shared Mailbox + Email Workspace

**Status:** Requirements
**Priority:** High
**Owner:** Messaging / Integrations
**Feature flags:** `email_workspace_enabled`, `gmail_channel_enabled`

### 1. Description

Add a company-level Gmail connection page in Settings and a separate `/email` operator workspace inspired by Front's shared inbox layout. This feature is scoped to one shared Gmail / Google Workspace mailbox per company and must cover the core email workflow inside Blanc: connect mailbox, receive emails, send new emails, reply in-thread, search, and work with attachments.

This slice is intentionally **not** an omnichannel expansion of `Pulse`. In v1, email lives in its own workspace because the desired UX is a Front-style inbox/list/thread surface, while the current `Pulse` implementation is phone/SMS-thread-first. The two areas may deep-link to each other when a contact or thread match exists, but they are not merged into one timeline in this iteration.

### 2. User Scenarios

#### SC-01: Connect the company Gmail mailbox from Settings
**Actor:** Admin with integration/company settings access
**Precondition:** User opens `/settings/email`
**Flow:**
1. User sees the current company email status: `Not connected`, `Connected`, `Reconnect required`, or `Sync error`.
2. User clicks `Connect Gmail`.
3. Google OAuth flow is started for a Gmail or Google Workspace mailbox.
4. After successful authorization, Blanc stores the connection against the current `company_id`.
5. Settings page shows the connected mailbox address, last successful sync time, and actions: `Reconnect` and `Disconnect`.

#### SC-02: Open the email workspace
**Actor:** Dispatcher / manager / agent with internal messaging access
**Precondition:** User navigates directly to `/email` or opens it from the Settings menu
**Flow:**
1. The page loads a Front-like three-pane layout:
   - left rail / mailbox navigation,
   - middle thread list,
   - right thread detail + composer pane.
2. The workspace opens on the default company mailbox, not on a personal inbox.
3. Threads are ordered by the most recent email activity.
4. If no mailbox is connected, the page shows an empty state with a CTA to `/settings/email`.

#### SC-03: Read a thread
**Actor:** Internal user with email access
**Precondition:** Company mailbox is connected and at least one thread exists
**Flow:**
1. User selects a thread from the list.
2. The right pane shows the full thread in chronological order.
3. Each message displays sender, recipients, CC, subject, timestamp, body, and attachments.
4. Opening the thread marks unread state as read for Blanc's internal workspace.

#### SC-04: Send a new email
**Actor:** Internal user with send permission
**Precondition:** Company mailbox is connected
**Flow:**
1. User clicks `Compose`.
2. User enters `To`, optional `CC`, subject, body text, and attachments/images.
3. The message is sent from the connected company mailbox.
4. A new thread is created in `/email` and becomes visible in the thread list.

#### SC-05: Reply inside an existing thread
**Actor:** Internal user with send permission
**Precondition:** Existing email thread is open
**Flow:**
1. User clicks `Reply` in the thread pane.
2. User edits recipients as allowed by normal reply semantics, adds body text and optional attachments.
3. The outbound message is stored and synced as part of the same thread.
4. Subsequent inbound replies continue to appear in the same Blanc thread.

#### SC-06: Receive inbound emails
**Actor:** Internal user with email access
**Precondition:** Company mailbox is connected
**Flow:**
1. New inbound emails synced from Gmail appear in `/email` without opening Gmail.
2. If Gmail identifies the email as part of an existing thread, Blanc attaches it to that same internal thread.
3. If it is a new conversation, Blanc creates a new thread row.
4. Thread list row shows unread state, sender, subject/snippet, timestamp, and attachment indicator when applicable.

#### SC-07: Search emails and threads
**Actor:** Internal user with email access
**Flow:**
1. User enters a search query in `/email`.
2. Blanc searches across sender/recipient addresses, CC, subject, body text, and attachment filename metadata.
3. Results are returned as threads, not as detached individual messages.
4. Selecting a result opens the matching thread and highlights the relevant message when possible.

#### SC-08: Work with attachments
**Actor:** Internal user with email access
**Flow:**
1. User can attach files and images to a new email or reply.
2. Incoming and outgoing messages display attachment chips/previews.
3. User can open or download an attachment from the thread pane.
4. Attachment visibility stays scoped to the exact email message that contains it.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-01: Security and tenancy
- All email routes require `authenticate` + `requireCompanyAccess`.
- `company_id` must be resolved only from `req.companyFilter?.company_id`.
- Gmail connection state is company-scoped; one company cannot access another company's mailbox or synced email data.
- OAuth tokens / refresh tokens must not be exposed to the frontend after initial authorization and must be stored securely.

#### NFR-02: RBAC reuse
- V1 should reuse existing permissions instead of introducing a new RBAC matrix:
  - `/settings/email` — `tenant.integrations.manage`
  - `/email` read access — `messages.view_internal`
  - send/compose/reply actions — `messages.send`
- Users without send permission may still view threads if they have read permission, but composer actions must be hidden or disabled.

#### NFR-03: Threading model
- Gmail `threadId` is the canonical thread key whenever available.
- Header-based email continuity (`Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To`, `References`) is the fallback for sync/import edge cases.
- V1 does not expose configurable threading modes in UI; threading behavior is fixed and product-controlled.

#### NFR-04: Delivery and sync model
- V1 does not require Front-level collaboration or queue orchestration features such as assignment, internal comments, shared drafts, snooze/later/done, or inbox rules.
- V1 does not require `Pulse`-grade real-time parity on day one; a reliable sync loop plus manual refresh is acceptable if Gmail push/SSE wiring is not ready yet.
- Any future realtime support must be additive and must not change the core `/email` data model.

#### NFR-05: Search and performance
- Thread list and search must be server-driven, not client-filter-only.
- Opening `/email` should render the initial thread list without loading full message history for every thread.
- Thread detail loads on demand and supports attachments without blocking the full page render.

#### NFR-06: UX direction
- `/email` should visually follow a Front-like operator workflow: mailbox navigation, thread list, thread pane, inline composer.
- This is a directional inspiration, not a 1:1 clone. V1 should not import advanced Front features that are outside the approved scope.

### 4. Affected Modules

#### 4.1 Backend Services
| Module | Change |
|--------|--------|
| **New:** `backend/src/routes/email.js` | REST API for thread list, thread detail, send, reply, search, and attachment retrieval. |
| **New:** `backend/src/routes/email-settings.js` | Company-scoped settings API for Gmail status, connect/reconnect/disconnect, and sync health. |
| **New:** `backend/src/services/emailService.js` | Gmail API wrapper, send/reply logic, MIME parsing, threading, and attachment metadata extraction. |
| **New:** `backend/src/services/emailSyncService.js` | Incremental sync/backfill worker for inbound email import and thread refresh. |
| Existing worker/runtime services | May be extended only as needed for background sync scheduling or event fan-out. No requirement to refactor Twilio/Pulse workers as part of v1. |

#### 4.2 Frontend Pages & Components
| Module | Change |
|--------|--------|
| `frontend/src/App.tsx` | Add routes for `/email` and `/settings/email`. `/email` is a standalone route; it is not added to the top navigation tabs. |
| `frontend/src/components/layout/appLayoutNavigation.tsx` | Add an `Email` entry to the Settings dropdown only. Keep top-level navigation unchanged. |
| **New:** `frontend/src/pages/EmailPage.tsx` | Front-like email workspace shell and route component. |
| **New:** `frontend/src/pages/EmailSettingsPage.tsx` | Settings page for connecting and managing the shared Gmail mailbox. |
| **New:** `frontend/src/services/emailApi.ts` | Frontend API wrapper for `/api/email` and `/api/settings/email`. |
| **New:** `frontend/src/components/email/*` | Thread list, thread row, thread pane, message item, composer, search bar, empty/error states. |

#### 4.3 Database / persistence
| Store | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `company_settings` | Store non-secret email workspace preferences and optional UI metadata under a dedicated `setting_key`; OAuth credentials must not be stored here. |
| **New:** `email_mailboxes` | Company-scoped connected mailbox record with provider account identity, encrypted tokens, connection state, and sync health. |
| **New:** `email_threads` | Internal thread records scoped by `company_id`, keyed to Gmail thread identity and searchable in `/email`. |
| **New:** `email_messages` | Individual inbound/outbound email records with sender, recipients, body, sync metadata, and provider IDs. |
| **New:** `email_attachments` | Attachment metadata and storage references linked to `email_messages`. |
| **New:** `email_sync_state` | Sync cursor / history state per company mailbox for incremental Gmail import. |

### 5. Affected Integrations

#### 5.1 Gmail / Google Workspace
- Gmail is the only supported provider in v1.
- Connection must support Gmail and Google Workspace mailboxes through Google OAuth.
- V1 supports one shared company mailbox only.
- Personal inboxes, delegated inboxes, aliases, and multi-mailbox routing are explicitly out of scope.

#### 5.2 Existing Blanc messaging stack
- Existing SMS routes/services (`/api/messaging`, `MessagesPage`, `Pulse`) must remain functional and unchanged in behavior.
- Email must not reuse SMS-specific tables or Twilio-specific message services.
- Contact/lead/job linking may be added opportunistically, but email send/receive/search must not depend on those links being present.

#### 5.3 Keycloak / permissions
- No new Keycloak roles are required for v1 if the existing permissions listed above are sufficient.
- If later implementation discovers a real gap, it may introduce an email-specific permission as a follow-up, not as a prerequisite for this slice.

### 6. Out of Scope (v1)

1. Personal mailboxes or delegated teammate inboxes.
2. More than one connected mailbox per company.
3. Assignment, ownership queues, workload balancing, inbox rules, or routing automation.
4. Internal comments / discussions on email threads.
5. Shared drafts / collaborative drafting / draft takeover.
6. Snooze, Later, Done, ticket statuses, archive workflow parity with Front.
7. Embedding email into the current `Pulse` timeline.
8. AI-generated replies or AI email drafting.
9. Multi-provider support (Office 365, SMTP, IMAP, etc.).

### 7. Constraints

1. `/email` is a separate route and workspace, but it must not be added to the top navigation tabs in the current shell.
2. The connection UI lives in Settings as a dedicated page (`/settings/email`), not buried inside the generic integrations table.
3. V1 must assume exactly one shared mailbox per company.
4. If a mailbox is disconnected or auth expires, `/email` should fail gracefully with a reconnect CTA instead of a broken list pane.
5. Initial sync/backfill may be bounded to a recent window or a limited history import; full unlimited Gmail history import is not required for v1.
6. The feature should reuse existing project patterns where they already fit:
   - `company_settings` for company-level config,
   - `authedFetch` / typed frontend API wrappers,
   - route-level permission guards in `App.tsx`,
   - lazy-loaded detail panes and server-side search patterns.
7. `Pulse` remains the phone/SMS workspace in this phase; do not expand its current combined timeline contract to include email as part of this requirement.

## F014: Ads Analytics Microservice

**Status:** Requirements
**Priority:** High
**Owner:** Backend / Integrations
**Consumer:** external reporting scripts (first: ABC Homes Google Ads weekly report)

### 1. Description

Read-only HTTP surface that returns Blanc funnel data (inbound tracking calls → leads → jobs → revenue) for a requested period. Authenticated via the existing `integrationsAuth` middleware (`X-BLANC-API-KEY` + `X-BLANC-API-SECRET`) with a new scope `analytics:read` that is distinct from `leads:create`. No mutations, no PII enrichment — just aggregated funnel numbers plus raw rows for spot-checking.

### 2. User Scenarios

#### SC-01: Weekly summary for Google Ads script
**Actor:** external cron / Google Ads script holding an `analytics:read` API key
**Flow:**
1. Script calls `GET /api/v1/integrations/analytics/summary?from=2026-04-16&to=2026-04-22`.
2. Backend authenticates via `X-BLANC-API-KEY` + `X-BLANC-API-SECRET`, verifies `analytics:read` scope, applies rate limiter.
3. Backend aggregates calls for the tracking DID, leads created in the period, and jobs linked to those leads; returns a single summary object.
4. Script posts the numbers into the weekly ad-performance dashboard.

#### SC-02: Drill-down into raw rows
**Actor:** analyst investigating a discrepancy
**Flow:**
1. Analyst calls `/analytics/calls`, `/analytics/leads`, or `/analytics/jobs` for the same period with `limit`/`cursor` pagination.
2. Backend returns the underlying rows that back the summary (one call per `call_sid`, one lead per `serial_id`, one job per `zenbooker_job_id`).
3. Analyst reconciles numbers against the summary endpoint.

#### SC-03: Multi-DID scenario
**Actor:** script with a non-default tracking number
**Flow:** Script passes `tracking_number=+16175551234`; backend normalizes the phone and scopes the CTE to that DID. Default tracking number is `+16176444408` (ABC Homes main ad line).

#### SC-04: Reject oversized period
**Actor:** misbehaving client requesting 12 months of data at once
**Flow:** Backend rejects the request with `400 PERIOD_TOO_LARGE` when `to - from > 92 days`.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-01: Security
- All endpoints require `integrationsAuth` middleware chain (`rejectLegacyAuth → validateHeaders → authenticateIntegration → rateLimiter`).
- Per-request scope guard: `req.integrationScopes` must include `analytics:read`.
- Per-company isolation: all aggregations filter by `req.integrationCompanyId` when that column is non-null on the integration row.
- No secrets in logs; keys follow the existing peppered SHA-256 storage pattern.

#### NFR-02: Time semantics
- All dates in query params are interpreted in `America/New_York` (ABC Homes operating TZ).
- `from` and `to` are inclusive on the calendar day; server math converts them to a half-open UTC range.
- Hard cap: `to - from <= 92 days` → `PERIOD_TOO_LARGE`.

#### NFR-03: Stability of contract
- Response shape mirrors the spec at `docs/specs/F014-ads-analytics-microservice.md`; numeric fields default to 0 when empty, not missing.
- Error envelope identical to `integrations-leads`: `{ success, code, message, request_id }`.
- Cursor pagination is opaque base64url of the last row's timestamp.

### 4. Affected Modules

| Module | Change |
|--------|--------|
| **New:** `backend/db/migrations/080_seed_analytics_scope.sql` | No-op DDL; marker file documenting `analytics:read` scope in column comment. |
| **New:** `backend/src/services/analyticsService.js` | `getSummary`, `listCalls`, `listLeads`, `listJobs`; shared CTE `tracked_calls → period_leads → attributed_leads`. |
| **New:** `backend/src/routes/integrations-analytics.js` | 4 GET endpoints; mirrors middleware chain of `integrations-leads`. |
| **New:** `backend/scripts/issue-analytics-key.js` | CLI to generate and persist an `analytics:read` API key. |
| `src/server.js` | Add `require`, mount router at `/api/v1/integrations`, update boot log. |

### 5. Affected Integrations

- **Google Ads reporting script** — first consumer. Weekly cron reads `/summary`.
- **ABC Homes tracking DID** — default `+16176444408`; overridable via `tracking_number` param.
- **Zenbooker / Front / Twilio** — no integration changes; the service only reads existing Blanc tables (`calls`, `leads`, `jobs`).

### 6. Constraints

1. Reuse `integrationsAuth` middleware — no new authentication mechanism.
2. Scopes live in `api_integrations.scopes` JSONB; no schema change required.
3. CommonJS backend; SQL-heavy service with a single canonical CTE for funnel attribution.
4. No caching layer in v1; each request hits Postgres. Rate limit is the safety net.
5. Attribution window: leads created within 24h of a tracking call are attributed to that call.
6. Revenue stored in `jobs.invoice_total` as TEXT; strip `[^0-9.]` regex for numeric aggregation.

---

## TWC-001: Twilio API Client Singleton

### 1. Description
All backend modules must share a single Twilio Node SDK client instance per process rather than instantiating a new client per function call. This eliminates per-instance `https.Agent` keep-alive pools that currently accumulate ~199 idle outbound TCP sockets to Twilio CloudFront endpoints in production, and removes a class of CLOSE_WAIT socket leaks.

### 2. User scenarios
1. Stale-call reconciliation: the inbox worker fetches Twilio call status for dozens of stale calls in succession — all requests route through one shared HTTPS connection pool, no fresh TLS handshakes per call.
2. inboxWorker processes a batch of webhook events — Twilio API calls inside one iteration reuse the same pool.
3. Operator availability checks (`callAvailability`) on every inbound call use the shared client — no new TLS setup per request.
4. Phone-settings endpoint calls Twilio Numbers API — zero connection-setup overhead.
5. Production VM (1 vCPU / 1 GB on Fly) sustains 5–10 ESTABLISHED outbound HTTPS sockets to Twilio CloudFront in steady state instead of 199+, with no CLOSE_WAIT sockets caused by abandoned agents.

### 3. Non-functional requirements
- **NFR-01 (Resource):** Process must not accumulate more than ~20 concurrent ESTABLISHED HTTPS connections to Twilio API in steady state.
- **NFR-02 (Compatibility):** Public Twilio SDK surface (`client.calls`, `client.lookups`, `client.conversations`, `client.messages`, `client.api.accounts(...).incomingPhoneNumbers`, etc.) is unchanged — migration is mechanical at call-sites with no behavior change.
- **NFR-03 (Configuration):** Credentials are read from `process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`. No new environment variables.
- **NFR-04 (Lazy init):** The shared client is initialized lazily on first access so that test runners and CLI commands without TWILIO_* env do not fail at module-load time.
- **NFR-05 (Failure mode):** If credentials are missing, the first call to the client throws a clear error rather than silently constructing a broken client.
- **NFR-06 (Multi-tenant readiness):** TWC-001 introduces only a global singleton. A future per-company credential cache (analogous to `getClientForCompany` in `zenbookerClient.js`) is allowed but out of scope here.

### 4. Affected modules
- `backend/src/services/reconcileStale.js` — currently constructs `twilio()` inside `fetchAndUpdateFromTwilio`.
- `backend/src/services/callAvailability.js` — currently constructs `twilio()` inside availability check.
- `backend/src/services/inboxWorker.js` — constructs `twilio()` per webhook event.
- `backend/src/routes/phoneSettings.js` — constructs `twilio()` per request.
- `backend/src/services/conversationsService.js`, `backend/src/services/twilioSync.js`, `backend/src/services/reconcileService.js` — already use module-level singletons; they may be refactored to use the new shared getter for uniformity.
- New module: `backend/src/services/twilioClient.js` — central lazy getter.

### 5. Affected integrations
- **Twilio** (Voice REST API, Lookups, Numbers, Conversations) — no API or behavior change; only HTTP-client lifecycle.

### 6. Protected
- `src/server.js`, TwiML routing, voice/recording behavior, webhook handling logic, reconcile semantics — unchanged.
- Existing per-module exports of services that already cache a singleton must keep their public API.

## F015: Document Templates Customization (Estimates first)

**Status:** Requirements
**Priority:** P0
**Owner:** CRM / Customization
**Related existing specs:** `docs/specs/PF002-R2-estimates-composer-refresh.md`, `docs/api/F015-document-templates-api.md` (TBD)

### 1. Description

Introduce a self-contained, extensible **Document Templates** module that lets a company customize the layout, branding, and free-text content of client-facing documents. The first document type is **Estimate**; the same model is designed to absorb **Invoice** and **Work Order** later by adding new `document_type` values without schema or renderer rewrites.

The current PDF renderer and the in-app HTML preview both rely on hardcoded constants in `backend/src/services/estimatePdfService.js` (`COMPANY_PROFILE`, `DEFAULT_TERMS_AND_WARRANTY`, `COLORS`) and a duplicated copy of the warranty text in `frontend/src/components/estimates/EstimatePreviewDialog.tsx`. F015 moves these values into a **versioned, JSON-encoded template descriptor** stored per company, makes them editable through a Settings page, and removes the duplication so PDF and HTML preview render from one source of truth.

This is an **additive** feature — no behavior change for tenants who do not edit their template. The first migration seeds one default template per existing company, byte-for-byte equivalent to the current hardcoded output.

### 2. User Scenarios

#### SC-01: View and edit the default Estimate template
**Actor:** Tenant admin (`tenant.integrations.manage` or new `tenant.documents.manage`)
**Flow:**
1. User opens **Settings → Document Templates**.
2. Sees a list grouped by document type with `Estimate` populated by one row labeled `Default` (the seeded template).
3. Clicks the row; an editor opens with the current template descriptor split into form fields (Brand, Sections, Terms, Footer).
4. User edits company name, accent color, ACH details, terms & warranty text.
5. Clicks **Save**; backend validates and persists; user returns to the list.
6. Next PDF/preview rendered for an estimate uses the updated template.

#### SC-02: Live preview while editing
**Actor:** Tenant admin
**Flow:**
1. In the editor, user toggles a section visibility (e.g., hide ACH).
2. The right-hand pane re-renders the in-app HTML preview using the in-progress descriptor against a fixture estimate.
3. Save commits the change; reload preserves the new state.

#### SC-03: Reset to factory default
**Actor:** Tenant admin
**Flow:**
1. User clicks **Reset to default** on a template.
2. Confirmation dialog appears.
3. On confirm, the descriptor is overwritten with the seeded factory descriptor; previous content is discarded (versioned but not user-recoverable in P0).

#### SC-04: Render uses the company's template
**Actor:** End user generating an estimate PDF
**Flow:**
1. User opens an estimate and clicks **PDF**.
2. Backend resolves `default` template for `(company_id, 'estimate')`; if none, falls back to the factory descriptor.
3. PDF is rendered using the descriptor; result is identical to the legacy hardcoded output for an unedited template.

#### SC-05: Future document types (forward-compatibility)
**Actor:** Product / engineering
**Flow:**
1. A new document type (`invoice`) is added by extending the `document_type` enum check, seeding a factory descriptor, and adding a renderer entry that knows the section semantics for invoices.
2. The Settings page automatically lists the new type because it reads document types from a registry, not a hardcoded array.

### 3. Functional Requirements

#### 3.1 Storage
- New table `document_templates`: `id, company_id, document_type, name, slug, is_default, schema_version, content (JSONB), created_at, updated_at, archived_at, created_by, updated_by`.
- Unique partial index on `(company_id, document_type)` where `is_default = true AND archived_at IS NULL` — enforces exactly one active default per `(company, type)`.
- All access scoped by `company_id` via `req.companyFilter?.company_id`.
- `document_type` constrained to `('estimate')` initially; designed to accept `'invoice', 'work_order'` later.
- `schema_version` is an integer (start at `1`); used by the renderer to dispatch to a version-specific reader.

#### 3.2 Template descriptor (JSON, schema_version=1)
The descriptor is the canonical document model, equivalent to the current hardcoded output:
```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "brand": {
    "name": "ABC Homes",
    "address": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "phone": "...",
    "logo_url": null,
    "ach": { "bank": "...", "routing_number": "...", "account_number": "..." }
  },
  "theme": {
    "ink": "#172033", "muted": "#5f7085", "faint": "#eef3f8",
    "surface": "#fbfcfe", "border": "#d8e0ea",
    "accent": "#2563eb", "danger": "#be123c"
  },
  "sections": [
    { "key": "header", "visible": true },
    { "key": "ach", "visible": true },
    { "key": "client_addresses", "visible": true },
    { "key": "summary", "visible": true },
    { "key": "items", "visible": true },
    { "key": "totals", "visible": true },
    { "key": "terms", "visible": true, "body_md": "TERMS: ...\n\nWARRANTY:\n- ..." }
  ],
  "footer": { "show_page_number": true, "text_md": null }
}
```
- Section `key`s are a fixed registry per `document_type`; renderer rejects unknown keys.
- Section order is the array order; the editor exposes a drag-and-drop reorder in P1 (P0 = fixed order, visibility toggles only).
- Free text fields (`terms.body_md`, `footer.text_md`, future block content) are **Markdown** (CommonMark subset: bold, lists, line breaks, no raw HTML, no images).

#### 3.3 Backend API (mounted under `/api/document-templates`)
- `GET /api/document-templates?document_type=estimate` — list templates for the company.
- `GET /api/document-templates/:id` — fetch by id (404 if cross-company).
- `POST /api/document-templates` — create (P0: only system seeds; user-create available via clone in P1).
- `PUT /api/document-templates/:id` — update name and content; validates against schema.
- `POST /api/document-templates/:id/reset` — overwrite content with the factory descriptor for the document type.
- `POST /api/document-templates/:id/preview` — server-side render of the descriptor against a fixture estimate; returns HTML descriptor JSON consumed by the frontend preview.
- `GET /api/document-templates/factory/:document_type` — returns the read-only factory descriptor.
- All endpoints require `authenticate, requireCompanyAccess`, and the new permission `tenant.documents.manage`.

#### 3.4 Renderer integration
- `estimatePdfService.renderEstimatePdf(estimate, descriptor)` accepts a descriptor parameter; when omitted, resolves the default for the company.
- A new module `documentTemplatesService.resolveTemplate(companyId, document_type)` returns the active default or, if none, the factory descriptor.
- `EstimatePreviewDialog.tsx` reads the same descriptor (via a new `/api/estimates/:id/render` JSON endpoint or via the template API + estimate data) so that PDF and preview never diverge.

#### 3.5 Settings UI
- New page at `/settings/document-templates` (linked from the Settings nav).
- List page: groups by document type; each row shows name, default badge, last updated, and an `Edit` action.
- Editor page: form-based with sections — **Brand**, **Theme** (color pickers), **Sections** (visibility toggles), **Terms & Warranty** (Markdown textarea), **Footer**. Right pane shows a live preview rendered from the in-progress descriptor.
- Reset, Save, Discard actions; unsaved-changes guard on navigation.

#### 3.6 Validation
- Server-side: JSON-schema validation (Ajv) of the descriptor; reject unknown section keys, malformed colors, body_md exceeding 8000 chars.
- Client-side: identical schema enforced by a TypeScript type derived from the same JSON Schema (single source of truth in `backend/src/services/documentTemplates/schema/v1.json`).

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Backwards compatibility:** an estimate rendered with no template change must be byte-identical to the pre-feature output (golden test).
- **Migration:** factory descriptor seeded per existing company in the same migration that creates the table.
- **Performance:** template fetch must add ≤10ms to the PDF endpoint (single indexed lookup, cached per request).
- **Security:** Markdown is rendered to PDF text (no HTML escape hatch); on the HTML preview, the Markdown is rendered with a sanitizer (allowlist).

### 5. Out of scope (P0)
- WYSIWYG / drag-drop block editor (P1).
- Multiple templates per `(company, document_type)` with switching at render time (P1).
- Invoice and Work Order document types (data-only follow-up).
- Logo upload (only `logo_url` string; upload pipeline TBD).
- Template versioning UI / restore previous version (P2).

### 6. Acceptance criteria
- AC-1: A fresh tenant has exactly one row in `document_templates` for `document_type='estimate'`, `is_default=true`, with content equal to the factory descriptor.
- AC-2: Rendering an estimate with the seeded template produces a PDF byte-equivalent to the legacy renderer (golden test).
- AC-3: Editing the company name in the template and re-rendering the same estimate reflects the new name in the PDF and HTML preview.
- AC-4: A non-admin user (`tenant.documents.manage` denied) gets `403` on all `/api/document-templates` endpoints; cross-company `:id` returns `404`.
- AC-5: Removing the `terms` section's visibility hides the section in PDF and HTML preview.
- AC-6: Adding a new `document_type` only requires (a) extending the CHECK constraint, (b) registering a factory descriptor, (c) registering a renderer adapter — no UI code change to list types.

## F016: VAPI AI — Marketplace Integration + Call Flow Gating

**Краткое описание:** Добавить VAPI AI как приложение в маркетплейс (`/settings/integrations`).
Кнопка "Enable" на плитке ведёт на **отдельную страницу настройки** `/settings/integrations/vapi-ai`,
где пользователь вводит API key, верифицирует и настраивает SIP resource.
После подключения нода `vapi_agent` становится доступной в редакторе Call Flow для групп
(`/settings/telephony/user-groups/:id/flow`). Без подключения — нода скрыта.

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. Пользователь открывает `/settings/integrations` → вкладка Marketplace → видит плитку "VAPI AI" со статусом "Available".
2. Нажимает "Configure" (или "Enable") → навигация на `/settings/integrations/vapi-ai` — полноценная страница настройки.
3. На странице: секция "API Connection" — поля API Key, Display Name, Environment (prod/dev), кнопка "Verify & Connect" → POST /api/vapi/connections. При успехе поля маскируются, статус меняется на "Connected".
4. После успешного подключения появляется секция "SIP Resource" — поля SIP URI, Server URL, кнопка "Save" → POST /api/vapi/resources. После сохранения показывает SIP URI в режиме просмотра.
5. После заполнения обеих секций — кнопка "Finish Setup" → POST /api/marketplace/apps/vapi-ai/install → статус installation меняется на "Connected". Пользователь может вернуться на `/settings/integrations`.
6. При ошибке верификации API key — inline error под полем, форма не очищается.
7. Если VAPI уже подключён (есть active installation) — страница показывает текущий статус и SIP URI в режиме просмотра, кнопка "Disconnect" → POST /api/marketplace/installations/:id/disconnect.
8. Пользователь открывает Call Flow Builder для группы → нода VAPI AI видна в insert picker (потому что VAPI connected). Без подключения — нода не появляется.

**Ограничения и нефункциональные требования:**
- API key никогда не показывается после сохранения (masked ••••••••).
- Call Flow Builder проверяет наличие active VAPI connection при загрузке (`GET /api/vapi/connections`).
- Стиль страницы: Blanc design system (--blanc-bg, --blanc-ink-1, --blanc-line, rounded-xl, IBM Plex Sans/Manrope). Без горизонтальных линий. Без пустых полей.
- TypeScript строгая типизация во всех новых файлах.
- Плитка VAPI в маркетплейсе: при наличии active installation кнопка меняется на "Manage" → переход на ту же страницу настройки.

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули/части системы:**
- `backend/db/migrations/088_seed_vapi_ai_marketplace_app.sql` — регистрация app в маркетплейсе
- `backend/src/db/marketplaceQueries.js` — добавить 088 миграцию в ensureMarketplaceSchema
- `frontend/src/services/vapiApi.ts` — новый типизированный API клиент
- `frontend/src/pages/VapiSettingsPage.tsx` — новая страница настройки VAPI
- `frontend/src/pages/IntegrationsPage.tsx` — кнопка "Configure"/"Manage" на плитке VAPI ведёт на страницу
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` — зарегистрировать роут `/settings/integrations/vapi-ai`
- `frontend/src/pages/telephony/CallFlowBuilderPage.tsx` — гейтинг vapi_agent ноды

**Затронутые интеграции:** Vapi (через /api/vapi/* backend)

**Защищённые части кода:**
- `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`
- `src/server.js` (только добавить роут для VapiSettingsPage если нужно — но это SPA, не нужно)
- Существующий `MarketplaceConnectDialog` в IntegrationsPage.tsx (не изменять)
- Существующая логика insert picker в CallFlowBuilderPage.tsx (расширить, не переписывать)

## F017: Согласованность Softphone и User Groups — единая система управления звонками

**Источник истины:** `docs/specs/F017-telephony-groups-softphone-consolidation.md` (полные функциональные требования, утверждены).

**Краткое описание:** Связать две независимо работающие подсистемы — Softphone и User Groups — в единую систему маршрутизации звонков. Группа становится единицей маршрутизации: номер принадлежит ровно одной группе, у группы есть call flow и агенты; входящий звонок исполняет flow группы и рингует только её доступных агентов; Softphone видит только номера и звонки своих групп.

**Ключевые продуктовые решения:**
1. Агент может состоять в нескольких группах; получает звонки из всех своих групп.
2. Доступность агента — только автоматическая: `on_call` = активный звонок, `available` = нет звонка, `offline` = Softphone закрыт.
3. Исполнение call flow при входящем звонке — приоритет №1.
4. Единственная стратегия дозвона — Simultaneous; Round Robin / Most Idle / Sequential / Weighted убираются из UI и логики.
5. Без draft/published: одна актуальная версия flow на группу, сохранение = немедленное применение.

**Проблемы текущего состояния:**
- Softphone виден всем с `phone_calls_allowed=true`, без учёта групп.
- Входящий звонок рингует ВСЕХ разрешённых, игнорируя группу/flow/расписание/стратегию.
- Caller ID picker показывает все client-номера без фильтра по группам пользователя.
- Flow Builder строит SCXML-граф, но он не исполняется при реальных звонках.
- `UserGroupDetailPage` читает mock (`userGroupsMock.ts`), а не API.
- Статус агента не синхронизирован с реальным звонком.
- Ring Strategy хранится, но не исполняется.

**Пользовательские сценарии (укрупнённо, детали в спецификации):**
1. Входящий на номер группы в рабочие часы → flow: Hours Check → Queue → рингует только available-агентов группы → агент принимает.
2. Все агенты заняты → по таймауту Queue → Voicemail.
3. Пользователь не в группах → кнопка Softphone не отображается, Twilio Device не инициализируется.
4. Пользователь в Sales и Support → Caller ID picker показывает номера обеих групп с подписями.
5. Завершение звонка → статус агента авто → `available`, SSE обновляет страницу User Groups.
6. Админ редактирует flow → Save → следующий звонок идёт по новой версии без шага публикации.
7. Привязка занятого номера к другой группе → предупреждение "already assigned to [Group]. Move it?".

**Затронутые модули:**
- Backend: `userGroups.js`, `voice.js` (blanc-numbers), `twilioWebhooks.js` (handleVoiceInbound), новый сервис исполнения flow, миграции БД, `src/server.js` (mount-only).
- Frontend: `useSoftPhoneWidget.ts`, `SoftPhoneHeaderButton.tsx`, `UserGroupsPage.tsx`, `UserGroupDetailPage.tsx` (убрать mock), `PhoneNumbersPage.tsx`, `CallFlowBuilderPage.tsx`, `OperationsDashboardPage.tsx`.

**Затронутые интеграции:** Twilio Voice (inbound webhook, Dial, Record), VAPI (SIP transfer node — уже реализован).

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):**
- `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useRealtimeEvents.ts`
- `src/server.js` core middleware (изменения только mount-only)
- `backend/db/` schema — менять только через задачи с явным планом миграций

**Non-goals:** hold/swap/conference, многоуровневый IVR, биллинг, UI записей звонков, RBAC на уровне групп, версионирование flow.

## CRM-SALES-MCP Cross-stage Requirements

**Status:** Implemented and audited

- Stage 0 CRM core exposes `/api/crm` over tenant-scoped services and SQL. Account/contact/deal cards, activities, tasks, notes, metadata, lists, pipeline, allowed writes, before/after audit, and deal history are implemented.
- Stage 1 MCP backend adapter exposes tool definitions and calls over `/api/crm/mcp`; tools are separated into read/write, arguments are runtime-validated, write tools require `sales.crm.write` and confirmation, and CRM errors map to sanitized MCP responses.
- Stage 2 transports expose the same MCP protocol through authenticated backend JSON-RPC, public token-protected HTTP, legacy SSE, and stdio. Public/stdio writes are disabled unless explicitly enabled.
- Stage 3 read-only tools expose explicit seller workflows for deal hygiene, forecast windows, account/contact follow-up, tasks, last customer-facing activity, and deal history.
- Pipeline/forecast analytics tools expose pipeline by owner/team/period, grouping by stage/forecast category, totals, changes, risky deals, and slippage.
- Stage 4 write MCP tools expose typed updates for `deal.next_step`, `deal.stage`, `deal.forecast_category`, `deal.close_date`, `deal.amount`, `deal.risk_summary`, `deal.competitor`, and `task.status`. Each write requires tenant context, `sales.crm.write`, explicit confirmation, before/after response, generated-or-propagated request id, and audit logging.
- Stage 5 Sales workflow selections expose `crm.list_sales_workflows`, generic `crm.get_sales_list`, and explicit read tools for my open deals, closing this month/quarter, deals without activity, deals without next step, risky deals, top accounts by pipeline, accounts needing follow-up, contacts missing role/title/email, and tasks due this week.
- Stage 6 testing and rollout mounts `/api/crm` and `/api/crm/mcp` behind authenticated tenant middleware, mounts public `/mcp/crm` behind token-gated MCP auth, and verifies the minimum regression suite for auth, tenant isolation, writes, audit, no delete tools, secret redaction, slippage/history, stale activity, and workflow lists.

**Cross-stage constraints:**
- `company_id` comes from `req.companyFilter?.company_id` or env-bound public/stdio context, never from client payload.
- Sales workflow calendar windows use company timezone from auth/env context, falling back to `America/New_York`.
- No MCP bulk/delete tools are registered.
- Required typed MCP arguments reject `null` unless the specific write value schema is nullable for explicit field clearing. Legacy generic deal writes validate `value` against the selected allowlisted field before dispatch.
- Current pipeline truth is `crm_deals`; changes/slippage use `crm_deal_history`; weekly snapshots are optional baselines only.

## ALB-100: Albusto Commercial Platform Program

**Status:** Requirements
**Priority:** P0
**Owner:** Platform / Identity / RBAC
**Date:** 2026-06-12
**Predecessor:** PF007-HARDENING-001 (provider scope, tenant isolation, deny-by-default RBAC — done)
**Decisions locked with product owner (2026-06-12):**
SMS-код 6 цифр; 2FA на новом устройстве + раз в 30 дней (trusted device);
новая компания активна сразу (super admin может suspend); отдельный платформенный
аккаунт для super_admin; кастомные страницы auth (Keycloak под капотом); онбординг —
минимум (название компании + город/zip через Google Places → таймзона выводится);
Google-вход пропускает email-верификацию, телефон обязателен до входа;
полный ребрендинг видимого UI в Albusto в этой итерации.

Программа из шести воркстримов:

### ALB-101: Self-Registration & Sign-In (Albusto Identity UX)

**Description.** Публичные экраны `app.albusto.com`: регистрация компании и вход.
Identity plane остаётся Keycloak (пользователи, пароли, Google IdP, сессии);
вся видимая поверхность — кастомные React-страницы в дизайн-системе продукта
(тёплая палитра Blanc-стиля, бренд Albusto). Backend оркестрирует Keycloak Admin API.

**Scenarios.**
- SC-01 Email-регистрация: email+пароль+имя → письмо-подтверждение (ссылка) →
  телефон (E.164, с маской) → SMS-код 6 цифр (3 попытки, TTL 5 мин, resend c
  countdown 30 сек) → онбординг-визард.
- SC-02 Google-регистрация: кнопка "Continue with Google" → Keycloak Google IdP →
  email уже подтверждён → шаг телефона + SMS-код → онбординг.
- SC-03 Вход: email/пароль или Google; если устройство не доверено или
  доверие старше 30 дней → SMS-код на привязанный номер → trusted-device cookie
  (httpOnly, 30 дней, per-device id).
- SC-04 Онбординг-визард (один экран): название компании + поле
  "City or ZIP" c Google Places autocomplete (по мере ввода — подсказки);
  выбор подсказки сохраняет city/state/zip/lat/lng и **выводит timezone**
  (Google Time Zone API) — пользователь таймзону не выбирает. Сабмит →
  POST /api/platform/companies (bootstrap: company + tenant_admin membership +
  role configs) → редирект в продукт.
- SC-05 Смена/потеря телефона: tenant_admin может сменить телефон сотрудника
  (сбрасывает trusted devices); super admin — для tenant_admin.

**Constraints.**
- Телефон обязателен до первого входа в продукт (включая Google-путь).
- OTP: 6 цифр, хранится хэш (та же pepper-схема, что api_integrations), max 3
  проверки, max 5 отправок/номер/час, TTL 5 мин; SMS через существующий Twilio.
- Rate limiting на /signup и /otp эндпоинтах; коды в audit_log не пишутся.
- Новые публичные роуты не требуют auth, но живут отдельным router'ом с
  жёсткими лимитами; никакие tenant-данные через них недоступны.
- Email-верификация — стандартный Keycloak flow (required action), Google — нет.

### ALB-102: Platform Companies API + Super Admin Panel

**Description.** PF103 §2: `POST /api/platform/companies` (self-service bootstrap,
вызывается signup-флоу без platform-роли — internal path), а также
`GET/PATCH /api/platform/companies[...]` для платформенного super admin.
SuperAdminPage получает таб Companies: список (имя, город, статус, дата,
кол-во пользователей, последняя активность), suspend/restore c reason,
карточка компании (метаданные + audit summary; НЕ бизнес-данные тенанта).

**Constraints.** Bootstrap-флоу идемпотентен (повторный сабмит не плодит
компании); company.created/suspended → domain events в audit_log;
суспенд → COMPANY_SUSPENDED на всех tenant-роутах (уже реализовано в PF007).

### ALB-103: PF007-HARDENING-002 — calls/messaging/leads/email

**Description.** Тот же метод, что HARDENING-001: аудит внутренних запросов на
tenant-фильтры + granular permissions на роутах `/api/calls`,
`/api/messaging`, `/api/conversations`, `/api/leads`, `/api/email`.
Ключи: `reports.calls.view` (звонки), `messages.view_internal/send`,
`leads.view/create/edit/convert`, email → `messages.view_client`.
Provider (assigned_only) видит звонки/сообщения только своих клиентов
(через jobs mirror, как contacts/pulse).

### ALB-104: Provider Bridge UI (Team Management)

**Description.** В карточке сотрудника CompanyUsersPage — секция Field tech:
тумблер is_provider; при включении — селект "Zenbooker team member" (ростер из
GET /api/zenbooker/team-members, поиск по имени), статус маппинга
(зелёная точка = привязан), кнопка Unlink. Сохранение через существующий
PATCH /api/users/:id (profile.zenbooker_team_member_id). После сохранения —
toast "Provider linked — N jobs now visible to this user" (счётчик из
refreshCompanyProviderMirror). Если ростер недоступен (нет Zenbooker
интеграции) — поле ручного ввода id с подсказкой.

### ALB-105: CI Tenant-Safety Sanitizer

**Description.** Jest-тест `tests/tenantSafetyLint.test.js` (без новых dev-deps):
сканирует backend/src/routes и backend/src/db на запрещённые паттерны:
`req.user?.company_id` / `req.user.company_id` в роутах (кроме allowlist
keycloakAuth/устаревших файлов с явным комментарием), `req.companyId`,
интерполяция `${...}` внутри SQL-литералов с company/user переменными,
`FROM contacts|jobs|leads|timelines...` без company-условия в новых query-файлах
(эвристика + allowlist). Падает с понятным сообщением "tenant-safety violation".

### ALB-106: super_admin Migration Completion + Albusto Rebranding

**Description.**
(a) `/api/admin/*` переводятся с requireRole('super_admin') на
requirePlatformRole('super_admin'); создаётся платформенный аккаунт
(admin@albusto.com, platform_role=super_admin, БЕЗ memberships); realm-роль
super_admin перестаёт давать доступ (фронтовый legacy-fallback в
ProtectedRoute удаляется); help@bostonmasters.com остаётся только tenant_admin.
(b) Полный ребрендинг видимых строк UI: "Blanc" → "Albusto" (шапка, тайтлы,
PWA-манифест, login/signup, письма); внутренние идентификаторы кода
(blanc-* CSS-переменные, BLANC_* env) НЕ трогаем — только пользовательские строки.

**Protected (program-wide):** src/server.js (точечные mount'ы — можно),
frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts, frontend/src/hooks/useRealtimeEvents.ts,
миграции 001–096, существующие Twilio webhook-флоу, integrations API (Service
Direct/rely lead flow), VAPI tools endpoint.

**Affected integrations:** Twilio (SMS OTP — новый usage), Google
(Places/Time Zone API — новый usage; OAuth IdP через Keycloak), Keycloak
(Google IdP, registration orchestration), Zenbooker (ростер — read-only).

---

## ALB-107: Multi-tenant Telephony — Twilio Subaccounts

**Status:** Requirements → In progress
**Priority:** P0 (коммерческая платформа)
**Date:** 2026-06-12
**Verified live:** Subaccounts API (create/list, auth_token в ресурсе),
AvailablePhoneNumbers search, Pricing API (US local $1.15/mo, toll-free $2.15/mo).
Ограничение Twilio: операции с субаккаунтами требуют master Account SID +
Auth Token (API Keys не работают) — подтверждено (20003 на CLI-профиле с ключом).

### Модель
Один master-аккаунт Twilio (ISV-модель) + **субаккаунт на каждую tenant-компанию**:
полная изоляция номеров, звонков, usage и (suspend) биллинга. Boston Masters
(legacy, company 0000…0001) остаётся на master-аккаунте.

### Функционал tenant-кабинета (Settings → Telephony → Phone Numbers)
1. **Connect telephony** — один клик: создаётся субаккаунт `Albusto <Company>`,
   статус подключения отображается.
2. **Поиск номеров**: по area code / городу / digits (contains), фильтры
   voice/sms; показ locality + цены ($/mo из Pricing API).
3. **Покупка номера** — в субаккаунт компании, webhooks настраиваются
   автоматически (voice-inbound/status/fallback → api.albusto.com), запись в
   phone_number_settings(company_id).
4. **Список номеров компании**: номер, friendly name (inline rename),
   город/возможности, назначенная группа/маршрут (существующий F017),
   дата покупки.
5. **Release номера** — confirm-диалог, освобождение в Twilio + удаление
   настроек.
6. **Изоляция**: tenant видит только свои номера; кросс-tenant id → 404.
7. **Suspend компании** (platform admin) → suspend субаккаунта (звонки и
   закупки блокируются Twilio-стороной).

### Маршрутизация webhooks
Все номера всех субаккаунтов указывают на одни URL. Компания определяется по
`AccountSid` из webhook payload (company_telephony lookup), fallback — по `To`
номеру (phone_number_settings). Подпись валидируется токеном соответствующего
субаккаунта.

### Phase 2 (реализовано 2026-06-12)
- **A2P 10DLC ISV-регистрация**: TrustHub secondary customer profile + A2P
  trust product + Brand (Low-Volume Standard, skipAutomaticSecVet) + tenant
  Messaging Service (пул номеров) + US A2P campaign. State machine в
  company_a2p_registrations, polling статусов; UI: баннер "SMS limited /
  registered" + wizard бизнес-данных (legal name, EIN, адрес, контакт) +
  one-click создание кампании после approve бренда.
- **Softphone per tenant**: API Key + TwiML App создаются в субаккаунте при
  подключении; /api/voice/token минтит Access Token кредами субаккаунта
  (legacy-компания остаётся на env).
- **Usage per tenant**: this-month сводка из Usage Records ($total, звонки,
  SMS, номера) — чип на странице номеров.

### Roadmap (phase 3)
- Port-in номеров (LOA-флоу), международные номера, billing-марж и инвойсинг

## AUTO-001: Automation/Rules Engine — End-to-End

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-06-13
**Foundation:** ADR-001 (commit 588c0d8) — eventBus, rulesEngine, ruleActions,
automation_* tables, /api/automation CRUD already exist. This feature makes it
usable end-to-end.

### Description
Превратить заложенный rules-engine в рабочую фичу: визуальный редактор правил
для tenant-админа, фоновый исполнитель agent-задач, и перенос хардкод-триггеров
(`arConfigHelper`) на правила.

### User scenarios
- **SC-01 (редактор):** Tenant-админ открывает Settings → Automation, видит
  список правил, создаёт правило мастером: выбирает триггер (событие из
  каталога ИЛИ таймер «через N после события»/cron), задаёт условия
  (field/op/value, AND/OR), добавляет действия (send_sms/email/create_task/…)
  с превью подстановки `{{...}}`, сохраняет, включает/выключает.
- **SC-02 (история):** В карточке правила — последние запуски
  (`automation_rule_runs`): статус, время, результат действий, ошибка.
- **SC-03 (agent-задача):** Правило с действием `run_agent_task` создаёт
  задачу kind=agent; фоновый worker берёт её (queued→running), вызывает
  agent-логику (включая MCP-инструменты в tenant-контексте), пишет
  output/status (succeeded/failed), эмитит `agent_task.succeeded|failed`.
- **SC-04 (миграция AR):** Существующие AR-триггеры (inbound_sms, missed_call)
  доступны как преднастроенные seed-правила; старый `arConfigHelper`-путь
  помечен к удалению (за фиче-флагом переключается на rules-engine).

### Constraints
- RBAC: всё под `tenant.company.manage`; tenant-изоляция (company_id из
  `req.companyFilter`); чужие правила/runs/задачи → 404.
- Не ломать существующий AR-флоу: миграция за флагом
  `FEATURE_RULES_ENGINE_AR` (default off), старый путь работает пока флаг off.
- Agent-worker идемпотентен (claim через UPDATE…RETURNING, без двойного
  исполнения), ошибки не валят процесс.
- Тесты обязательны (RBAC 401/403, изоляция, worker-claim, миграция AR).

### Out of scope
- Сложные visual flow-граф редакторы (форма-конструктор достаточно).
- Реальные LLM-агенты (worker вызывает существующие сервисы/MCP; LLM-агенты —
  отдельная фича).

## BILLING-UI: Subscription & Billing Cabinet (UX-first)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-06-13
**Foundation:** ADR-001 §2.4 (billingService, /api/billing, stripeProvider) — commit 588c0d8.

### UX intent (designed first)
Владелец компании, не разработчик. Экран `/settings/billing` отвечает на 4 вопроса
без технического шума (без id подписки/клиента/счёта):
1. В каком я состоянии? — крупный статус (Trial · N days left / Active / Past due)
   с человеческой датой окончания.
2. Сколько потратил? — usage-полоски (Text messages / Call minutes / Automations
   run) против лимитов плана; зелёный <80%, янтарный 80-100%, красный при превышении.
3. Как продолжить/апгрейдиться? — карточки планов (Pro = Most popular), кнопка →
   Stripe Checkout.
4. Где мои счета? — список: дата, статус (Paid/зелёный, Failed/красный), сумма,
   View → hosted invoice.

### Scenarios
- SC-01: Новая компания после онбординга — trial автоматически стартовал
  (14 дней), баннер «9 days left».
- SC-02: Апгрейд — клик Upgrade → Checkout redirect → возврат `?status=success`
  → подписка active (через webhook).
- SC-03: Просмотр счетов — клик View открывает hosted invoice Stripe в новой вкладке.
- SC-04: Неоплата — Stripe webhook `invoice.payment_failed` → статус past_due →
  баннер с просьбой обновить карту (через Customer Portal/Checkout).

### Constraints
- RBAC `tenant.company.manage`; tenant-изоляция; webhook — без auth, raw body,
  проверка подписи Stripe v1.
- Без технических идентификаторов в UI (дизайн-принципы CLAUDE.md).
- Trial стартует в bootstrapCompany (онбординг), идемпотентно.
- FEATURE-флаг не нужен (read-only пока нет STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: UI деградирует —
  показывает trial/usage, кнопки апгрейда disabled с подсказкой).
- Тесты: webhook-подпись, trial-старт, usage-расчёт, RBAC.

### Out of scope
- Customer Portal управление картой (фаза 2 — пока через повторный Checkout).
- Proration/downgrade-флоу.

## F018: Stripe Payments Marketplace — Tenant Customer Payments (Phases 1–2)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P0 · **Date:** 2026-06-14
**Источник:** `docs/specs/STRIPE-PAY-001-stripe-payments-marketplace.md`
**Статус реализации:** Phases 1–5 реализованы (2026-06-14). Исключение: on-device Tap
to Pay NFC UI заблокирован отсутствием mobile shell (web-only SPA); backend Terminal
(connection-token + card_present payment-intent + cancel) готов.

**Scope (изначальный прогон):** Phase 1 (marketplace app + Stripe Connect onboarding +
страница `/settings/integrations/stripe-payments` + readiness gating) и Phase 2
(invoice payment links, public `Pay now`, webhook → canonical ledger sync). Phases 3–5
(manual card / Payment Element, Terminal/Tap to Pay backend, refunds + disputes +
reporting source filter) добавлены следующим прогоном.

**Краткое описание:** Любая tenant-компания может подключить приём платежей Stripe
из маркетплейса Albusto и собирать оплату от своих клиентов через invoice payment
link (Stripe Checkout). Все успешные платежи попадают в canonical
`payment_transactions` (`external_source='stripe'`). Это **tenant→customer** платежи,
строго отделённые от **platform billing** (BILLING-UI / ADR-001 — оплата подписки
Albusto самой компанией).

**Связь с существующими фичами (НЕ дублирует):**
- **Расширяет PF004 (Payment Collection):** PF004 явно вынес card processing,
  provider webhooks, Tap to Pay, refunds за пределы P0 и писал только recorded/manual
  платежи в `payment_transactions`. F018 добавляет Stripe-процессор поверх того же
  ledger — не создаёт второй payment-center.
- **Переиспользует паттерн F016 (VAPI marketplace):** marketplace плитка → отдельная
  страница настройки `/settings/integrations/<app>` → `provisioning_mode='none'` seed →
  install/disconnect через существующие `/api/marketplace/*`.
- **Отдельно от BILLING-UI/ADR-001:** не трогает `billingService`, `/api/billing`,
  `stripeProvider` платформенного биллинга и его webhook `/api/billing/webhook`.

**Продуктовые решения (зафиксированы):**
1. Charge model — **direct charges**, tenant = merchant of record, **без application
   fee** (закрывает open decision §16 спеки).
2. Stripe Connect Accounts v2, по одному connected account на компанию.
3. **Tap to Pay отложен** (нет mobile shell; web-only Vite SPA). В этом прогоне — нет.
4. Manual card entry (Payment Element), refunds, reporting-фильтры — следующие прогоны.

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. Tenant admin: `/settings/integrations` → плитка `Stripe Payments` (статус
   `Available`) → `Configure` → `/settings/integrations/stripe-payments`.
2. Admin запускает Stripe onboarding (Connect), возвращается, видит readiness states
   (account connected / payments capability / payouts / requirements due / webhook /
   test-vs-live) и setup checklist. Плитка отражает состояние (Available / Setup
   incomplete / Connected / Action required / Payouts disabled / Disconnected).
3. Online collection заблокирован, пока нет `charges_enabled` + card capability.
4. По invoice с balance > 0 authorized user создаёт и копирует Stripe payment link
   (Checkout Session от текущего balance); повторный запрос переиспользует валидную
   сессию, не плодит дубликаты.
5. Invoice send dialog: toggle `Include payment link` (по умолчанию on при balance>0 и
   готовом Stripe), email/SMS, редактируемое тело, copy/preview, warning если не готов.
6. Public invoice page: `Pay now` → создаёт/переиспользует Checkout Session по
   opaque-токену (без internal id), redirect в Stripe.
7. После оплаты Stripe webhook идемпотентно пишет одну строку в `payment_transactions`
   и обновляет invoice `amount_paid`/`balance_due`/`status` через canonical path; failed
   attempt виден в UI, но не создаёт completed-платёж.
8. Admin может Disconnect: новые платежи выключаются, история сохраняется.

**Ограничения и нефункциональные требования:**
- Card data только через Stripe-controlled UI/SDK; Albusto не хранит/не логирует
  PAN/CVC/bank data; secrets — в env, не в tenant metadata.
- Tenant-payments webhook **отдельный** от platform billing webhook, mounted до JSON
  parsing с raw body, проверка подписи (`STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).
- Каждый Stripe object проходит tenant-scope verification перед ledger mutation.
- Идемпотентность: webhook по `stripe_event_id`; ledger по `(company_id, external_id)`;
  payment initiation с idempotency keys; UI терпит webhook delay (processing state).
- Все API: `authenticate, requireCompanyAccess`; `company_id` только из
  `req.companyFilter.company_id`; все SQL фильтруют по `company_id`.
- Blanc design system на странице настройки (без `<hr>`, без пустых полей).

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули/части системы:**
- Backend: новые миграции (`stripe_connected_accounts`, `stripe_payment_sessions`,
  `stripe_webhook_events`, seed marketplace app); `backend/src/services/stripePaymentsService.js`,
  `stripeConnectProvider.js`; `backend/src/routes/stripePayments.js`,
  `stripePaymentsWebhook.js`; расширение `backend/src/routes/invoices.js`,
  `backend/src/routes/public-invoices.js`; mount в `src/server.js` (mount-only).
- Reuse: `paymentsService.createTransaction` (`external_source='stripe'`),
  `invoicesService.recordPayment`, `invoicesQueries.createEvent`, `ensurePublicLink`,
  marketplace install/disconnect, `marketplaceQueries.ensureMarketplaceSchema`.
- Frontend: `frontend/src/pages/StripePaymentsSettingsPage.tsx`,
  `frontend/src/services/stripePaymentsApi.ts`; правки `IntegrationsPage.tsx` (плитка),
  `App.tsx` (роут), `components/invoices/InvoiceDetailPanel.tsx` (Collect vs Record
  offline), invoice send dialog, public invoice page.

**Затронутые интеграции:** Stripe (Connect, Checkout Sessions, webhooks). Не Twilio/
Front/Zenbooker (SMS-отправка payment link использует существующий messaging path).

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):**
- `src/server.js` core middleware/SSE (только mount-only добавления).
- `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`, `frontend/src/hooks/useRealtimeEvents.ts`.
- `backend/db/` — только новые миграции по явному плану.
- Платформенный billing: `billingService`, `/api/billing`, `stripeProvider`,
  `/api/billing/webhook` — не изменять.

### Out of scope (этот прогон)
- Manual card / Payment Element (Phase 3); Tap to Pay / Terminal (Phase 4); refunds +
  dispute visibility + расширенные reporting-фильтры (Phase 5); application-fee funds flow.

## NOTES-001: Unified Notes — Edit, Soft-Delete & Audit History

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** High · **Type:** Feature + Refactor
**Scope:** Job / Lead / Contact notes threads only (estimate "Summary" & invoice "Notes" are separate document fields — OUT of scope).

### Description
Consolidate all notes UIs onto the single shared `NotesSection` (used via `NotesHistoryTabs` in the job/lead/contact cards) and add lifecycle management: edit text, add/remove attachments on existing notes, soft-delete — every edit/delete recorded as an audit event in the History tab. Today notes are append-only JSONB arrays (`jobs.notes`, `leads.structured_notes`, `contacts.structured_notes`) with `text`, `created`, author **name**, optional `attachments` — **no stable id, no `created_by` user-id, no `deleted_at`**. Attachments link positionally (`note_attachments.note_index`) and `getEntityHistory` reads notes by array index — both break under edit/delete, so a **stable note id is mandatory**.

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-1..3 Unify:** Jobs/Leads/Contacts notes render through one `NotesSection`; delete dead `StructuredNotesSection.tsx` + `JobNotesSection.tsx`; do not touch estimate/invoice fields.
- **FR-4..6 Identity:** every note gets a stable id (unique within the array, stable across edits/reorders/ZB sync); new notes record `created_by` (req.user.sub); attachments + history key off the id, not array index.
- **FR-7..11 Edit:** per-entity edit endpoint by note id; one save can change text + remove attachments + add attachments; preserves id/created/created_by/position; emits `note_edited` (old→new text, added/removed attachment names, actor).
- **FR-12..15 Soft-delete:** per-entity delete endpoint by note id; sets `deleted_at` + actor without removing from JSONB; **every** notes/history-notes read path excludes soft-deleted notes; emits `note_deleted` that stays in History.
- **FR-16..17 Audit:** reuse `eventService.logEvent`/`domain_events` + `getEntityHistory`; render `note_edited`/`note_deleted` events; keep live (non-deleted) notes rendered from JSONB.
- **FR-18..19 UI:** edit/delete only via a per-note kebab (⋮); show only the actions the current user may perform (else no kebab).

### Permission matrix
| Note class | Tenant admin | Author (own) | Other non-admin |
|---|---|---|---|
| `created_by` = current user | Edit+Delete | Edit+Delete | none |
| `created_by` = another user | Edit+Delete | n/a | none |
| Legacy (name only, no `created_by`) | Edit+Delete | none | none |
| No author | Edit+Delete | none | none |
| Zenbooker-synced | Edit+Delete | none | none |

Admin = tenant_admin role / `membership.role_key`. Non-admin may edit/delete **only** notes whose `created_by` = their user-id. Ownership unverifiable (legacy/no-author/ZB) → **admin only**. **All checks enforced server-side** (direct API call by a non-admin on another's note → 403); kebab visibility is convenience only.

### Data & lifecycle
- **DR-1** Backfill a stable id onto every existing note (idempotent migration) so legacy notes are admin-editable.
- **DR-2** Add `created_by` to note objects; new notes set it; absent → unverifiable ownership (admin-only).
- **DR-3** Add `deleted_at` (+ deleting actor); soft-deleted notes retained in JSONB but filtered from all reads.
- **DR-4** Move attachment linkage from positional `note_index` to the stable note id (or a compat mapping).
- **DR-5** Edit/delete audit via `domain_events` (`logEvent(companyId,'job|lead|contact',entityId,'note_edited|note_deleted',{...},'user',req.user.sub)`); no new audit table.
- **DR-6** Note id stable across Zenbooker re-sync (no duplicate/resurrect/re-index).

### Constraints
Multi-tenant: company_id ONLY from `req.companyFilter`. Backwards-compatible with pre-migration notes (tolerate missing fields; no data loss). Zenbooker sync must preserve new fields + stable ids; ZB notes admin-only. New endpoints sit alongside existing `requirePermission('*.edit')` + add ownership/admin check. Reuse `eventService`. Respect `noteAttachmentsService` max-files cap (surviving + added).

### Out of scope
Estimate "Summary", invoice "Notes", hard delete, un-delete UI, rich-text/@mentions/threading, per-note privacy/pinning.

### Acceptance criteria
AC-1 one `NotesSection` for jobs/leads/contacts; legacy components deleted. AC-2 new note persists id + created_by. AC-3 non-admin edits/deletes only own; no actions on others'/legacy/ZB. AC-4 admin edits/deletes any (incl. legacy/ZB). AC-5 server rejects non-admin editing another's note (403) even bypassing the kebab. AC-6 one edit can change text + remove + add attachment, keeping id/position/created/created_by. AC-7 edit emits `note_edited` (old→new + attachment deltas) in History. AC-8 deleted note gone from thread AND every notes/history-notes response. AC-9 `note_deleted` stays in History. AC-10 editing/deleting one note doesn't corrupt another's attachments. AC-11 cross-company isolation on all ops. AC-12 pre-migration notes still render and are admin-addressable after backfill; none lost. AC-13 ZB re-sync after edit/delete doesn't duplicate/resurrect/re-index.

## SLOT-ENGINE-001 — UX polish (2026-06-25)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P0–P3 polish · **Type:** UX / consistency / copy bugfix pack over the merged SLOT-ENGINE-001.
**Scope (HARD):** frontend `frontend/src/components/conversations/CustomTimeModal.{tsx,css}` and `slot-engine/src/engine.js` (`explain()`) ONLY. No engine architecture, API contract, DB, scoring, or multi-tenant changes.
**Naming:** product is **Albusto**. New user-facing copy must contain no "Blanc". Do NOT rename `--blanc-*` CSS tokens or code identifiers (BlancBadge, etc.) — "Blanc" is internal-only.

### Description
The slot-picker side panel (`CustomTimeModal`) and the engine's `explain()` ship machine-y, partly-Russian, jargon-heavy output in an all-English UI. This pack closes the design-critique findings: clean English explanations, a single visual quality signal, consistent "Recommended/Preselected" vocabulary, a human empty state, warm Albusto tokens, reused components, and accessibility/dead-code cleanup. No behavior of the recommendation algorithm changes.

### Requirements (per finding)

**SE-UX-1 (P0) — `explain()` returns a clean English reason only.**
`engine.js` `explain()` currently returns Russian text with the typo "технік", a "Риск: …" line, and a redundant `${date}, ${win.start}-${win.end}, ${tech.name}` prefix the card already renders.
- AC-1: `explanation` is English, with no Russian characters and no "технік"/"Риск" strings anywhere in engine output.
- AC-2: `explanation` contains NO date, time/window, or technician name — only the reason (e.g. "Tech already working nearby · low added travel · comfortable schedule buffer"). Empty/short candidates yield a sensible terse English reason, never an empty string that breaks the card.
- AC-3: No engine test asserts on the literal explanation text (assert on type/shape only), so copy can evolve freely.

**SE-UX-2 (P1) — One visual quality signal (temperature mini-bar); humanized dispatch flag; no snake_case leak.**
The rec card today renders three raw machine signals: integer `score`, raw `confidence` enum, and the jargon flag "Dispatch confirm".
- AC-4: The score+confidence quality signal is shown as ONE thin vertical "temperature" mini-bar on the card edge; fill height and color map to tier (high → green, medium → blue, low → amber/muted). Minimal footprint.
- AC-5: The raw numeric score is OFF the card face — present only in a hover `title`/tooltip and/or `aria-label` for accessibility. The standalone `confidence` text chip and the raw `<span class="ctm-rec-card__score">` number are removed from the visible card.
- AC-6: "Dispatch confirm" is replaced by a separate humanized actionable flag "Approx. address — confirm" (amber), rendered ONLY when `requires_dispatch_confirmation` is true.
- AC-7: The `reason_codes?.[0]` fallback never leaks snake_case to the UI; with `explain()` fixed, the visible sub-text is always human English (humanized fallback if `explanation` is ever missing).

**SE-UX-3 (P1) — Vocabulary: engine = "Recommended", copied-tech = "Preselected".**
- AC-8: Panel header reads "Recommended times" (was "Suggested times"); the engine tech-bar pill reads "Recommended".
- AC-9: The copied-from-duplicate tech pill reads "Preselected" (was "Suggested"); related comments/labels for that lane use "Preselected", not "Suggested".

**SE-UX-4 (P2) — Human empty state when engine is enabled but returns zero recs.**
Today the panel vanishes silently when the engine is on but returns no recommendations.
- AC-10: When the marketplace app is installed/enabled and the engine returns zero recs (engine reachable, empty result — distinct from disabled/unreachable), the panel shows "No nearby openings — try another day" instead of disappearing.
- AC-11: When the app is disabled or the engine is unavailable, the panel remains absent and the modal is unchanged (no regression to current graceful behavior).

**SE-UX-5 (P2) — Warm Albusto tokens; remove dead dark fallbacks.**
Timeline/date-nav/hour-labels use cold neutral tokens.
- AC-12: `--muted-foreground` → `--blanc-ink-3` and `--border` → `--blanc-line` across the touched CSS; dead dark fallbacks (`#27303f`, `#0f172a`, and the other `#1e293b/#334155/#64748b/#94a3b8`-style cold fallbacks in the same rules) are removed.

**SE-UX-6 (P2) — Technician pagination arrows use the Button component.**
- AC-13: The technician prev/next pagination arrows use the shared `Button` component (`variant="ghost"`, `size="icon"`), matching the date-nav arrows; raw `<button>` markup for them is removed.

**SE-UX-7 (P3) — Dead CSS, keyboard accessibility, no emoji.**
- AC-14: Dead CSS rules `.ctm-timelines__dots`, `.ctm-timelines__footer`, `.ctm-timelines__legend*` (and their orphaned children) are deleted.
- AC-15: The recommendation overlay bands (currently `<div onClick>`) are keyboard-accessible (focusable, Enter/Space activate, appropriate role/aria-label).
- AC-16: The 🕓 and 🔧 emoji in the map info-window markup are removed (Albusto rule: no emoji); the underlying time/service text remains.

### Constraints
- Touch only the three named files. No changes to engine scoring, ranking, config, output contract fields, the proxy/service, DB, or any tenant-isolation logic.
- Preserve existing graceful-degradation behavior (panel absent when disabled/unreachable).
- Frontend must build green (`npm run build` / tsc -b; prod Docker build is stricter — no unused locals).
- Do not introduce any user-facing "Blanc"; do not rename `--blanc-*` tokens or code identifiers.

### Out of scope
Engine algorithm/weights/feasibility, Google Routes upgrade, multi-tech, new fields/contracts, settings/base-location UI, the proxy and `slotEngineService`, any backend/DB work, and i18n/localization of the panel.

### Affected modules
- `frontend/src/components/conversations/CustomTimeModal.tsx` + `.css` (rec cards, tech pills, panel header, empty state, tokens, pagination arrows, overlay bands, map info window).
- `slot-engine/src/engine.js` — `explain()` only.

### Affected integrations
None (no Twilio/Front/Zenbooker/Google contract changes; engine I/O contract unchanged).

### Protected (do NOT break)
Engine scoring/ranking/feasibility pipeline and output contract; `slotEngineService`/proxy gating + safe-failure; marketplace install gating; multi-tenant isolation; `--blanc-*` token names and `Blanc*` identifiers; existing pick mechanism (click rec → applies slot+tech).

## ONWAY-001 — On-the-way ETA notification (2026-06-26)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Type:** Feature (technician dispatch UX + outbound SMS + new job status).
**One-liner:** From a job card in a pre-visit status, a technician taps a primary CTA, sees a device-geolocated Google travel-time ETA plus preset tiles, picks one, and taps "Notify client" → an outbound SMS (tech name + ETA) is sent to the customer, the message lands in the customer's conversation timeline, and the job flips to a new **On the way** status.

### Description
Technicians need a one-tap way to tell a customer they are en route, with a realistic arrival estimate, without leaving the job card or composing a message by hand. ETA is computed from the technician device's live geolocation (PWA) to the job's service address via Google travel-time (reusing `routeDistanceService`). The same action both notifies the customer (SMS recorded to the conversation) and advances the job into a new pre-visit-reachable status, **On the way**.

### Actors & entry point
- **Actor:** assigned technician (or dispatcher) holding the `messages.send` permission, viewing a Job card.
- **Entry:** the **"On the way"** button is the **primary CTA** on the Job card when the job is in a pre-visit status. Per the current Job FSM/`ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`, the pre-visit set is **Submitted**, **Rescheduled** (and, where applicable, a future **Scheduled** status if introduced by the FSM seed). "Waiting for parts" / "Follow Up with Client" / terminal states do not show it as primary. The exact reachable-from set is whatever the published Job FSM defines as transitions into **On the way**; the hardcoded fallback map must mirror it.

### User scenarios

#### SC-01 — Happy path with geolocation (mobile PWA)
1. Technician opens a job in **Submitted**/**Rescheduled** and taps the primary **"On the way"** CTA.
2. Modal opens and immediately requests `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition`.
3. Permission is granted and a fix is returned → frontend asks the backend to compute travel time from `{lat,lng}` (device) → job service address, reusing `routeDistanceService.computePair` (driving, no live traffic).
4. The computed Google ETA (rounded minutes) is shown pre-selected at the top; preset tiles **10 / 15 / 20 / 30 / 45 / 60** and a **"Set custom time"** row are also offered.
5. Technician keeps the Google value (or picks a tile / custom) and taps **"Notify client"**.
6. Backend sends the SMS via `conversationsService` (getOrCreateConversation + sendMessage) to the customer phone; the outbound message appears in the customer's conversation timeline; the job status is set to **On the way**.
7. Modal shows success and closes; the job card now reflects **On the way** and the CTA is no longer primary.

#### SC-02 — No geolocation / denied / desktop (fallback)
1. Technician (or desktop dispatcher) opens the modal; geolocation is unavailable, denied, or times out.
2. **No Google call is made.** The modal shows a placeholder such as **"ETA unavailable — location is off"** and offers only the preset tiles + **"Set custom time"**.
3. Technician picks a tile or custom value and taps **"Notify client"** → SMS sent with the chosen minutes; status set to **On the way** (same as SC-01 steps 6–7).

#### SC-03 — No customer phone
1. Technician taps the CTA / "Notify client" but the job's contact has no phone.
2. SMS cannot be sent; the action is blocked with a clear message ("No phone number on file for this customer"). **Status is NOT changed** (no silent "On the way" without a notification). No partial side effects.

#### SC-04 — No service address (ETA only)
1. Job has no usable service address / no `lat,lng` and cannot be geocoded.
2. Google ETA is not computed (placeholder shown, same as SC-02), but the flow still works via preset/custom tiles. Address absence blocks only the Google ETA, not the notification or the status change.

#### SC-05 — Wallet-blocked (insufficient balance)
1. Technician taps **"Notify client"**; the company wallet is at/below the grace floor (`walletService.assertServiceActive` throws inside `sendMessage`).
2. The SMS is rejected; the modal surfaces a wallet/billing message ("Messaging is paused — top up your balance"). **Status is NOT changed** (SMS is the primary success; status follows it).

#### SC-06 — SMS send failure (Twilio/transient)
1. Technician taps **"Notify client"**; `sendMessage` fails for a non-wallet reason (Twilio error, network).
2. The action reports failure and **does not** change the job status. Technician may retry. No duplicate status flip, no orphaned "On the way".

### Requirements & acceptance criteria

**OW-R1 — Primary CTA placement & gating.**
- AC-1: The **"On the way"** button renders as the **primary CTA** on the Job card only for jobs whose current status has a defined transition into **On the way** in the active Job workflow (pre-visit: **Submitted**, **Rescheduled**, future **Scheduled**). It is hidden (or non-primary) otherwise and never shown for terminal states.
- AC-2: The button/modal is available only to users with the required dispatch/messaging permission (`messages.send`); a user lacking it neither sees the action nor can call the endpoint (403).

**OW-R2 — Device-geolocation ETA.**
- AC-3: On modal open the client calls `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition`. If a fix is obtained AND the job has a usable address, the backend computes travel-time from device coords → job address by reusing `routeDistanceService` (driving, no `departure_time`/traffic); the rounded-minute result is shown pre-selected.
- AC-4: If geolocation is unavailable, denied, errors, or no address exists, **no Google request is made** and the modal shows the **"ETA unavailable — location is off"** placeholder with preset tiles + custom only. (No live/continuous tracking — a single `getCurrentPosition` per open.)

**OW-R3 — ETA selection model.**
- AC-5: The technician can choose exactly one ETA value from: the Google ETA (when present), a preset tile (**10/15/20/30/45/60**), or a **"Set custom time"** manual minute entry. Custom accepts a positive integer minute value; the chosen value is what is sent in the SMS.

**OW-R4 — Notify = SMS + status, in that priority order.**
- AC-6: "Notify client" sends the SMS via `conversationsService` (`getOrCreateConversation` with the customer phone + company proxy/DID resolved server-side, then `sendMessage`), recording it as an **outbound** message in the customer's conversation/timeline.
- AC-7: After a successful SMS, the job status is set to **On the way**. **Ordering:** SMS first; the SMS is the primary success signal. If the status set fails after a successful send, the API still returns success for the notification and surfaces a non-blocking warning that the status did not advance (no rollback of the sent SMS). If the SMS fails (incl. wallet block, SC-05/SC-06), the status is **not** changed.
- AC-8: No phone (SC-03) → blocked before send, status unchanged, clear error. No double-send and no double status-flip on retry/double-click (idempotent on the success path).

**OW-R5 — SMS template (English, exact).**
- AC-9: The message body is exactly:
  `Hi! Your technician {tech} from {company} is on the way and should arrive in about {eta} minutes.`
  where `{tech}` = assigned technician display name (from the job's assignment), `{company}` = company name, `{eta}` = chosen minutes (integer). All copy/UI is English.

**OW-R6 — New "On the way" job status.**
- AC-10: **On the way** is added as a NEW status to the Job workflow — to the hardcoded `BLANC_STATUSES`/`ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` fallback in `jobsService.js` **and** to the Job FSM SCXML seed (FSM-001), as a non-terminal state reachable from the pre-visit statuses, with sensible onward transitions (e.g. → Visit completed / Canceled). The fallback map and the seed must stay consistent.
- AC-11: The status is rendered in the standard Job status UI (status tags / list) like any other status; the standard transition/audit path records the change.

**OW-R7 — Multi-tenant & security.**
- AC-12: `company_id` is taken ONLY from `req.companyFilter` (never from client payload). The customer phone is derived from job → contact server-side. The proxy/company DID is resolved server-side. The endpoint enforces `requirePermission` (dispatch/messaging) + company scoping; a job from another tenant returns 404/403.

### Constraints / NFRs
- **Reuse, don't reinvent:** ETA via `backend/src/services/routeDistanceService.js` (`computePair`); SMS via existing `conversationsService.getOrCreateConversation` + `sendMessage` (wallet gate already enforced inside `sendMessage`). No new Twilio send path.
- **CommonJS backend**, English-only copy, Albusto design system (no user-facing "Blanc").
- **PWA geolocation only** for origin; desktop/no-permission degrades gracefully to tiles.
- Google travel-time call is **driving, no traffic** (consistent with SCHED-ROUTE-001) and only fired on cache-miss with a valid key; a missing key behaves like SC-02 (no ETA, tiles only).

### Affected modules
- **Backend:** `services/jobsService.js` (new status in `BLANC_STATUSES` + `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`; status-set on notify); `services/routeDistanceService.js` (reused for device→job ETA); `services/conversationsService.js` (reused send path); a route (e.g. under `routes/jobs.js` or `routes/messaging.js`) for "notify on the way" (compute ETA + send + set status); Job FSM SCXML seed (FSM-001) — add **On the way** state + transitions.
- **Frontend:** Job-card CTA in `components/jobs/JobStatusTags.tsx` (JobOpsSection, where the action bar now lives) + a new "On the way" modal component (geolocation request, ETA display, preset tiles, custom time, Notify button); `services/jobsApi.ts` for the new endpoint.

### Affected integrations
- **Twilio** (outbound SMS via Conversations — already wired through `conversationsService`).
- **Google Distance Matrix** (travel-time via `routeDistanceService`; key from env, never to browser).
- **Zenbooker:** the new **On the way** status is Blanc-internal; it must NOT regress the existing outbound ZB status sync (only sync if/when an explicit ZB mapping is defined — otherwise no outbound ZB call for this status).

### Protected (do NOT break)
- The existing `sendMessage` wallet gate (`walletService.assertServiceActive`) — it must remain the single enforcement point for outbound SMS cost.
- Existing Job FSM transitions/seed completeness (FSM-001 §8) and the hardcoded fallback — adding **On the way** must not drop or alter existing statuses/transitions.
- Existing outbound Zenbooker sync behavior on the current statuses.
- `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`, `useRealtimeEvents.ts`, `server.js` (shared infra, per FSM-001 protected list).

### Out of scope
- Live / continuous technician tracking (only a single `getCurrentPosition` per modal open — no streaming location, no map breadcrumb).
- Recurring or automatic ETA recomputation / auto-resend; no scheduled "running late" follow-ups.
- ETA accuracy beyond Google's single estimate (no traffic/`departure_time`, no multi-leg routing).
- Customer-facing live ETA page / link; inbound reply handling beyond the normal conversation flow.
- Localization/i18n of the SMS or modal (English only this pass).

## REC-SETTINGS-001 — configurable recommendation settings (2026-06-26)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Type:** New feature (per-company configuration over the merged SLOT-ENGINE-001).

**Краткое описание:** Replace the hardcoded `config_override` in `backend/src/services/slotEngineService.js` with **per-company settings** a dispatcher edits in the UI. The slot engine already accepts a `config_override` (deep-merged over `slot-engine/src/config.js` `DEFAULT_CONFIG`), so the only change is *where the override comes from* — there is **NO engine redeploy**. Exactly **5** parameters are exposed in a "Recommendation settings" block on the Settings → Technicians page (`frontend/src/pages/TechnicianPhotosPage.tsx`); two further values are always applied but never shown.

### Пользовательские сценарии

1. **View settings (first run / no row).** A dispatcher with `tenant.company.manage` opens Settings → Technicians. The "Recommendation settings" block shows the 5 fields populated with the **documented defaults** (Max distance 10 mi, Allow overlap 0 min, Min buffer 15 min, Planning horizon 3 days, Recommendations shown 3) even though no DB row exists yet. Behavior is well-defined for every company before anyone saves.
2. **Edit + save.** The dispatcher changes one or more fields (e.g. Max distance 10 → 15, Recommendations shown 3 → 5) and saves. The values are validated, persisted to the company's row, and the block reflects the saved values on reload.
3. **Recommendations use the saved values.** On the next slot-recommendation request for that company, `slotEngineService` reads the company's saved settings, builds the engine `config_override` from them (plus the two fixed values), and the returned recommendations reflect the new settings (e.g. a wider radius surfaces farther technicians; `top_n` controls how many cards return).
4. **Reset to defaults.** Clearing the form / restoring defaults and saving writes a config equal to the documented defaults; recommendations behave exactly as the untouched first-run case.

### Пользовательские параметры (exactly these 5)

Each maps to one or more engine `config_override` keys (deep-merged over `DEFAULT_CONFIG`).

| # | UI label | Control | Default | Validation | Engine config key(s) |
|---|----------|---------|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Max distance (mi)** | number input | **10** | integer **1–100** | `geography.max_distance_from_existing_job_miles` **AND** `geography.max_distance_from_base_if_empty_day_miles` (ONE radius → BOTH keys) |
| 2 | **Allow overlap (min)** | picker {0, 30, 60, custom} | **0** (no overlap) | integer **0–240** | `overlap.max_timeframe_overlap_minutes` |
| 3 | **Min buffer between jobs (min)** | picker {0, 30, 60, custom} | **15** | integer **0–240** | `feasibility.min_required_slack_minutes` |
| 4 | **Planning horizon (days)** | number input | **3** | integer **1–14** | `planning.horizon_days` |
| 5 | **Recommendations shown** | number input | **3** | integer **1–10** | `ranking.top_n` |

### Fixed values (ALWAYS applied in the built config_override, NOT in the UI)

- `geography.allow_empty_day_candidates = true`
- `workload.max_day_utilization = 0.95`

### Acceptance criteria

**RS-R1 — Storage / schema.**
- AC-1: A new table `slot_engine_settings(company_id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES company, config jsonb NOT NULL, created_at timestamptz, updated_at timestamptz)` is created via a migration. `company_id` is both PK and FK (one row per company).
- AC-2: `config` (jsonb) stores the 5 user-set parameter values. The two fixed values may be persisted or injected at build time, but they are ALWAYS present in the `config_override` the service sends to the engine regardless of stored content.

**RS-R2 — Defaults when no row (well-defined for every company).**
- AC-3: When a company has no `slot_engine_settings` row, GET returns the documented defaults (10 / 0 / 15 / 3 / 3) and `slotEngineService` builds the `config_override` from those same defaults plus the two fixed values. No request is ever sent with an undefined/partial parameter.

**RS-R3 — slotEngineService consumes saved settings (replaces hardcode).**
- AC-4: The hardcoded `config_override: { geography: { allow_empty_day_candidates: true, max_distance_from_base_if_empty_day_miles: 40 } }` in `getRecommendations` is REMOVED. The service instead reads the company's row (or defaults) and assembles `config_override` mapping each of the 5 parameters to the engine key(s) in the table above, plus the two fixed values.
- AC-5: `HORIZON_DAYS` (currently the local constant `2` used for `latest_allowed_date`) is driven by the **Planning horizon (days)** setting (i.e. `planning.horizon_days`), so the snapshot window and the engine config agree.
- AC-6: No change to `slot-engine/` is required; the engine receives the override and deep-merges it as today (no redeploy).

**RS-R4 — CRUD endpoints (GET + PUT only).**
- AC-7: `GET` returns the company's settings (or documented defaults when no row). `PUT` upserts the company's row with the validated 5 parameters.
- AC-8: Both endpoints enforce `requirePermission('tenant.company.manage')`.
- AC-9: `company_id` is taken **ONLY** from `req.companyFilter` — never from the client payload. A request without a resolvable company scope is rejected; a caller can never read or write another tenant's settings.

**RS-R5 — Validation (per parameter, server-enforced; the UI mirrors the same ranges).**
- AC-10: **Max distance** integer 1–100 mi; **Allow overlap** integer 0–240 min; **Min buffer** integer 0–240 min; **Planning horizon** integer 1–14 days; **Recommendations shown** integer 1–10. Out-of-range, non-integer, or missing values are rejected (422) on PUT — no partial save.
- AC-11: For pickers (2, 3) the {0,30,60} options and the **custom** path both resolve to an integer that must satisfy the 0–240 range; "custom" cannot bypass validation.

**RS-R6 — UI (English, Albusto tokens, follows design canon).**
- AC-12: The "Recommendation settings" block lives on the Settings → Technicians page (`frontend/src/pages/TechnicianPhotosPage.tsx`), English copy, Albusto design tokens (`--blanc-*`, no user-facing "Blanc"). It shows exactly the 5 controls — the two fixed values are not surfaced. Section header uses the `.blanc-eyebrow` style; no horizontal separators.

### Ограничения и нефункциональные требования
- **No engine redeploy / no engine code change.** The engine `config_override` contract (`slot-engine/src/config.js` deep-merge) is reused unchanged.
- **Multi-tenant isolation:** `company_id` only from `req.companyFilter`; one row per company; cross-tenant read/write impossible.
- **RBAC:** all access under `requirePermission('tenant.company.manage')`.
- **English-only** copy, **Albusto** design system; CommonJS backend (consistent with `slotEngineService.js`).
- **Safe-failure preserved:** existing slot-engine safe-failure behavior in `slotEngineService` (empty, flagged result on any engine fault / missing `SLOT_ENGINE_URL`) must not regress; settings load failure must degrade to documented defaults rather than throw.

### Потенциально вовлечённые модули/части системы
- **Backend:** `backend/src/services/slotEngineService.js` (build `config_override` from settings; drop hardcode; drive horizon); a new settings service/queries for `slot_engine_settings`; a route exposing `GET`/`PUT` (alongside the existing `/api/settings/technician-base-locations` routes); a migration for the new table.
- **Frontend:** `frontend/src/pages/TechnicianPhotosPage.tsx` (the "Recommendation settings" block); a small settings API client (alongside the technician-base-locations client).

### Затронутые интеграции
- **Slot engine** (`slot-engine/`) — consumes the built `config_override`; **no redeploy**.
- Twilio / Front / Zenbooker / Google: **none** (Zenbooker still supplies the technician roster for recommendations, but is unaffected by this feature).

### Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать)
- The slot-engine `config_override` deep-merge contract and `DEFAULT_CONFIG` (`slot-engine/src/config.js`) — do not change engine defaults or merge semantics.
- `slotEngineService` safe-failure path (empty/flagged result on engine fault) and the snapshot-building logic (technicians, scheduled jobs, coverage).
- The existing `technician_base_locations` table, its settings screen, and its `GET/PUT/DELETE` routes — REC-SETTINGS adds a sibling, it must not alter base-location behavior.
- Multi-tenant `company_id` resolution via `req.companyFilter` and the `tenant.company.manage` permission convention.

### Out of scope
- **Any of the engine's internal parameters not in the 5 exposed** — explicitly: the travel model (`travel.*` — `model`, `average_city_speed_mph`, multipliers, edge limits, `geo_uncertainty_beta`), scoring weights and thetas (`scoring.*`), geo-confidence threshold (`geography.min_geo_confidence_for_auto_recommendation`), candidate time-frames / workday windows (`candidate_timeframes`, `workday.*`), durations (`durations.*`), and the other ranking/diversity caps (`ranking.max_recommendations_per_technician`, `ranking.max_recommendations_per_same_timeframe`). None are exposed or editable.
- Per-technician or per-territory overrides (settings are per-company only).
- Engine redeploy, engine algorithm/weights/feasibility changes, or any change to the engine API contract.
- Localization/i18n of the settings UI (English only this pass).
- Versioning/audit history of settings changes, and import/export of configs.

## REC-SETTINGS-002 — make `max_distance_miles` the effective empty-day coverage radius (2026-06-26)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Type:** Follow-up to REC-SETTINGS-001 (no new UI, no engine change).
**Predecessor:** REC-SETTINGS-001 (`docs/specs/REC-SETTINGS-001.md`).

### Problem (verified on prod)

In REC-SETTINGS-001 the **Max distance (mi)** setting (`max_distance_miles`) is mapped to the engine's GEO pre-filter only — both `geography.max_distance_from_existing_job_miles` and `geography.max_distance_from_base_if_empty_day_miles`. Those gates decide *which* candidates are **generated**. But an empty-day candidate (base → new job → base) is then independently re-checked by the engine's **TRAVEL-FEASIBILITY** gates (`travel.max_edge_travel_minutes`, `travel.max_extra_travel_minutes`), which are left at their `DEFAULT_CONFIG` values. With those defaults the empty-day extra-travel gate cuts off at **~4.5–5 mi straight-line from base** (empirically: a job at a tech base → recommendations; a job 5.4 mi away → 0 feasible) **regardless of how large `max_distance_miles` is set**. So a dispatcher who sets Max distance to 25 mi still effectively gets ~5 mi of empty-day coverage.

### Binding decisions (from the customer — fixed, not re-litigated here)

1. The radius (`max_distance_miles`) is the **effective coverage limit**. The natural upper bound is the technician workday (the engine's existing route / workday-fit checks). **No** additional hard drive-time ceiling.
2. The travel caps must **scale from `max_distance_miles`** with enough headroom that the **GEO gate (not travel) binds** for a job at exactly the radius on an empty day.
3. **No engine change / redeploy** — `config_override` already deep-merges `travel.*`. **No UI change.** The existing `geography.*` mapping (both keys = `max_distance_miles`) stays exactly as-is.

### Solution summary

`buildConfigOverride(settings)` (in `backend/src/services/slotEngineSettingsService.js`) additionally emits a `travel` block whose two empty-day-relevant caps are **derived from `max_distance_miles`** using the engine's own travel-time constants, plus a small headroom, so the geo radius becomes the binding constraint. Everything else (the 5 mapped params, the 2 fixed values, the geography mapping) is unchanged.

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1 (travel caps emitted from radius).** `buildConfigOverride` returns a `travel` object containing `max_edge_travel_minutes` and `max_extra_travel_minutes`, both computed from `max_distance_miles` via the documented formula (see `docs/specs/REC-SETTINGS-002.md`). No other `travel.*` key is emitted (the rest stay at engine defaults via deep-merge).
- **AC-2 (radius binds on an empty day).** For a job at exactly `max_distance_miles` straight-line from a tech base on an otherwise empty day, both travel gates pass with margin, so the candidate is rejected (if at all) only by the GEO gate / workday-fit — i.e. the geo radius is what bounds coverage, not travel. At the default 10 mi, empty-day coverage reaches ~10 mi (not ~5 mi).
- **AC-3 (never more restrictive than today).** The emitted `max_edge_travel_minutes` is always **≥ the engine default of 45**; the emitted `max_extra_travel_minutes` is always **≥ the engine default of 35** (both monotonically non-decreasing in `max_distance_miles`). The change can only ever *widen* feasibility versus the previous REC-SETTINGS-001 output, never narrow it.
- **AC-4 (existing-job + geography mapping unchanged).** The geography mapping (one radius → both geography keys + `allow_empty_day_candidates=true`), the `overlap`/`feasibility`/`planning`/`ranking` mappings, and `workload.max_day_utilization=0.95` are byte-for-byte unchanged from REC-SETTINGS-001. The travel caps also govern existing-job edges (the engine applies the same `travel.*` gates to non-empty routes); scaling them up cannot reject any edge the old defaults accepted (caps only grow).
- **AC-5 (defaults still safe).** With the documented defaults (`max_distance_miles=10`) the emitted caps make ~10 mi of empty-day coverage reachable rather than ~5 mi, while the workday/route-fit checks still bound long routes (a 10-mi empty-day round trip is well within the workday).
- **AC-6 (no engine / UI change).** No file under `slot-engine/` changes; no redeploy. No frontend file changes. Only `buildConfigOverride` (and its unit tests) change. Saved settings rows are untouched; a company with no row still resolves to DEFAULTS (10 mi) and now reaches ~10 mi empty-day coverage.

### Constraints / non-functional

- The formula's constants (`average_city_speed_mph`, `travel_time_multiplier`, `operational_buffer_minutes`, the engine edge/extra defaults 45/35) are **read from `slot-engine/src/config.js` DEFAULT_CONFIG and the `slot-engine/src/geo.js` travel model** — they are mirrored as documented literals in `slotEngineSettingsService.js`, NOT imported from the engine package (backend does not depend on `slot-engine/`).
- Safe-failure parity preserved: `resolve`→DEFAULTS on DB error still yields a complete, well-defined override (now including the travel block).

### Out of scope

- Any UI surface for the travel caps (they remain derived, never user-edited).
- A separate hard drive-time ceiling, per-technician travel tuning, or exposing `average_city_speed_mph` / multipliers.
- Changing `slot-engine/` defaults or merge semantics; any engine redeploy.
- Re-mapping the geography keys or adding a 6th user parameter.

### Protected (must not break)

- The REC-SETTINGS-001 `buildConfigOverride` mapping for the 5 params + 2 fixed values (extended, not altered).
- `slot-engine/` `DEFAULT_CONFIG` + `mergeConfig` deep-merge contract.
- `slotEngineService` consumption path and its safe-failure behavior.

## EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 — Email in the contact timeline (send + receive), on a mail-provider abstraction (2026-06-26)

### Problem statement

The contact timeline (Pulse, `GET /api/pulse/timeline/:contactId`) is the single place an agent works a client: it shows **calls + SMS + financial events** chronologically and lets the agent reply over SMS inline. But **email is invisible there.** The existing Gmail integration (**EMAIL-001**) syncs the company's shared mailbox into a *separate* inbox (`/email`), with no link from an email to the contact it belongs to and no presence in the timeline. So an agent who calls and texts a client in Pulse must leave for a different screen to see — and cannot at all *send* — that client's email. Email and the rest of the relationship live in two disconnected surfaces.

This feature wires **email into the same timeline**: inbound email from a known contact appears as a timeline message and raises unread exactly like an inbound SMS; the agent can **reply by email or initiate a new email thread** from the same composer that today sends SMS, choosing the channel by picking a phone or an email address in the "To" selector. It deliberately **reuses EMAIL-001** (Gmail OAuth, token storage/refresh, MIME send/reply, history sync, the `email_*` tables) rather than rebuilding any of it, and introduces a **mail-provider abstraction** so the timeline/exchange logic depends on a provider interface (Gmail today, IMAP/other later) and not on Gmail directly.

### Goals

- Inbound email from an address that maps to a contact shows in that contact's Pulse timeline as an **inbound message**, in chronological order with calls/SMS, and raises the same **unread** signals SMS does.
- Inbound is **near real-time** (Gmail `users.watch` → Google Pub/Sub push), not only the existing 5-minute poll.
- The agent can **reply to** an inbound email thread and **initiate** a brand-new email thread to a contact, from the Pulse composer, with **no subject field** (auto/`Re:` subject).
- The composer "To" selector offers the contact's **phone(s) and email(s)**; phone → SMS, email → email; the default channel mirrors the **last inbound channel**.
- When the company has **no connected Gmail mailbox**, the email option(s) render a **connect CTA** (conversion path to the email settings page) instead of silently failing.
- The mail layer is behind a **`MailProvider` interface**; a future provider plugs in without touching timeline/exchange code.
- **Multi-tenant + permission-gated**, and the **standalone EMAIL-001 inbox keeps working unchanged**.

### Non-goals / out of scope (v1)

- **Attachments on timeline email** (inbound or outbound) — text only in the timeline. (The standalone inbox keeps its attachment support.)
- **HTML rendering** in the timeline — plain text only.
- Per-user / personal mailboxes (EMAIL-001 is one **shared** mailbox per company; unchanged).
- Auto-creating a contact from an unknown sender; merging duplicate contacts; any change to contact dedupe.
- A second mail provider implementation (IMAP) — only the **interface + Gmail impl** ship now.
- CC/BCC selection UI, read receipts, or threading multiple contacts onto one email thread.

### Reused (existing — do NOT rebuild)

- **EMAIL-001** (`## EMAIL-001` above): `emailMailboxService` (OAuth, encrypted tokens, refresh, `getValidAccessToken`), `emailSyncService` (`importGmailThread`, `syncIncrementalHistory`, scheduler), `emailService` (`sendEmail`, `replyToThread`, `buildMimeMessage`), `emailQueries`, tables `email_threads/email_messages/email_attachments/email_mailboxes/email_sync_state` (migration `079`), routes `email.js / email-oauth.js / email-settings.js`, frontend `emailApi.ts` + `components/email/*`.
- **Timeline/SMS**: `buildTimeline` in `backend/src/routes/pulse.js`; `sms_messages` + `conversationsService`; unread triplet (`sms_conversations.has_unread`, `contacts.has_unread`, `timelines.has_unread`); `findContactByPhoneOrSecondary` + `markContactUnread` + `markTimelineUnread`.
- **Composer**: `frontend/src/components/pulse/SmsForm.tsx` ("To" dropdown), `usePulsePage.ts` (`handleSendMessage`, last-used-phone), `PulseTimeline.tsx` + `SmsListItem.tsx`.
- **Provider-style precedent**: raw-body, signature-verified webhook mounted before `express.json` — `stripePaymentsWebhook.js` mounted at `src/server.js:75` — is the pattern for the Pub/Sub push endpoint.

### User stories

1. **Inbound → timeline.** As an agent viewing a contact in Pulse, when that contact emails our shared mailbox, I see their email appear in the timeline as an inbound message within seconds, and the contact is flagged unread — without leaving Pulse.
2. **Reply by email.** As an agent, when the contact's last inbound touch was an email, I open Pulse, the composer defaults to **Email**, I type a body and send, and my reply goes out **in the same email thread** (correct `Re:` subject + threading) and immediately appears outbound in the timeline.
3. **Initiate email.** As an agent for a contact I've only ever called, I pick the contact's email in the "To" selector and send the first email; a **new thread** is created with an auto subject, and it appears in the timeline.
4. **Channel choice.** As an agent, the "To" selector lists the contact's phone(s) and email(s); choosing a phone sends SMS, choosing an email sends email — one composer, explicit target.
5. **Not connected → convert.** As an agent at a company that hasn't connected Gmail, when I open the "To" selector the email entry shows "Google email not connected — connect to message clients by email" and links me to the email settings page.
6. **Inbox unaffected.** As an existing EMAIL-001 user, my standalone `/email` inbox, search, threads, and attachments work exactly as before; timeline wiring adds to it, nothing is removed.

### Functional requirements

**Inbound receive (real-time) — `FR-IN`**

- **FR-IN-1.** The system registers a Gmail **`users.watch`** for each connected mailbox (topic = configured Pub/Sub topic, `labelIds: ['INBOX']`) and stores the returned `historyId` + `watch_expiration`.
- **FR-IN-2.** A **push endpoint** receives Google Pub/Sub notifications, **verifies** the push (OIDC bearer token from Pub/Sub, audience check; or a shared `?token=` secret as configured), resolves the target mailbox by the notification's `emailAddress`, and triggers an **incremental history sync** for that company. It returns 2xx quickly; processing is idempotent.
- **FR-IN-3.** History processing **only creates timeline activity for INBOX messages from external senders.** Messages whose Gmail `labelIds` include `SENT` or `DRAFT`, or whose `from` equals the mailbox address (`direction='outbound'`), **MUST NOT** create a timeline entry or unread. **Editing a Gmail draft MUST NOT** produce timeline activity.
- **FR-IN-4.** For each qualifying inbound message, the system resolves the sender via `from_email` against `contacts.email` **and** `contact_emails.email_normalized`, **company-scoped**. On a match it links the message to that contact and **adds it to the contact's timeline** as an inbound message.
- **FR-IN-5.** On a contact match for inbound email, the system raises **unread** mirroring SMS: `contacts.has_unread` (via `markContactUnread`) and the contact's `timelines.has_unread` (via `markTimelineUnread`), and emits the SSE/`messageAdded`-equivalent so an open Pulse refreshes live. Action-Required follows the same per-company `inbound_*` trigger config used for SMS.
- **FR-IN-6.** **No contact match → NOT added to any timeline.** The message remains visible only in the standalone EMAIL-001 inbox (unchanged). No contact is created.
- **FR-IN-7.** A **watch-renewal scheduler** re-arms each mailbox's `users.watch` before its ≤7-day expiry. The existing 5-minute poll (`emailSyncService` scheduler) is **kept as reconciliation** so a missed/failed push is recovered within 5 minutes.
- **FR-IN-8.** **Quote/signature handling for the timeline projection:** the timeline body strips quoted reply history (`On … wrote:` headers, `>`-prefixed lines, and known client thread markers) and keeps the new body text + signature. Plain text only (derived from `body_text`; never HTML). The original full `email_messages.body_text/html` is retained intact for the inbox.

**Outbound send — `FR-OUT`**

- **FR-OUT-1.** From the Pulse composer the agent can **send an email** to a selected contact email address: **reply** when an inbound email thread exists for that contact, or **initiate** a new thread otherwise.
- **FR-OUT-2.** **No subject field** in the composer. Reply → `Re: <thread subject>` (reuses `emailService.replyToThread`'s subject default). Initiate → an auto subject (e.g. `Message from <Company Name>`), no user input.
- **FR-OUT-3.** Reply **threads correctly**: it goes out via Gmail with the thread's `provider_thread_id` and `In-Reply-To`/`References` set from the thread's last message (existing `replyToThread` behavior). Initiate starts a **new** Gmail thread (`sendEmail`).
- **FR-OUT-4.** A sent timeline email is **hydrated and appears outbound** in the timeline immediately after send (reusing `importGmailThread` hydration in `emailService`), and is linked to the same contact.
- **FR-OUT-5.** Outbound email is gated by the **`messages.send`** permission (same as SMS-send and the existing email compose/reply routes) and tenant-scoped by `req.companyFilter.company_id`.
- **FR-OUT-6.** v1 outbound from the timeline is **text only** (no attachment upload in the Pulse composer email path).

**Channel routing + composer — `FR-UI`**

- **FR-UI-1.** The composer "To" selector lists the contact's **phone(s)** (primary + secondary, as today) **and email(s)** (from `contacts.email` + `contact_emails`). Selecting a phone routes to the **SMS** send path; selecting an email routes to the **email** send path.
- **FR-UI-2.** The **default selected channel/target** is the **last inbound channel**: if the contact's most recent inbound activity was an email → default to that email; if SMS → default to the SMS path (existing last-used-phone logic). With no inbound email, behavior is unchanged from today.
- **FR-UI-3.** If the company has **no connected mailbox** (or status ≠ `connected`), email entries in the selector render a **CTA state** — label "Google email not connected — connect to message clients by email" — that links to the email settings/connect page and is **not selectable as a send target**.
- **FR-UI-4.** Email timeline items render as **chat bubbles** consistent with SMS (inbound left / outbound right), plain text, with timestamp; a small affordance distinguishes email from SMS (e.g. a mail glyph / "Email" label). No HTML, no attachment chips in v1.

**Provider abstraction — `FR-PROV`**

- **FR-PROV-1.** A **`MailProvider`** interface defines the provider-facing contract: at minimum `getConnectionStatus(companyId)`, `fetch/parseMessages` (history-driven), `sendMessage({to, subject, body, inReplyTo, references, threadId})`, `startWatch/stopWatch/renewWatch(companyId)`, and `handlePushNotification(payload)`. A **`GmailProvider`** implements it by delegating to the existing EMAIL-001 services.
- **FR-PROV-2.** The **timeline/exchange layer depends only on the interface** — it never imports `googleapis` or Gmail-specific services directly. Adding a future provider (e.g. IMAP) requires implementing `MailProvider` + registering it, with **no change** to the timeline/exchange/contact-matching code.

**Multi-tenant / permissions — `FR-SEC`**

- **FR-SEC-1.** Every email read/write is scoped by `company_id` from `req.companyFilter?.company_id`; cross-company email never appears in another company's timeline or inbox.
- **FR-SEC-2.** Timeline email read follows existing Pulse gating (`pulse.view`, provider `assigned_only` visibility); outbound requires `messages.send`. The Pub/Sub push endpoint is **unauthenticated by user** but authenticated by **push-token/OIDC verification** (no `company_id` from a session — resolved from the notification payload).

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1 (inbound external email lands on the timeline + unread).** Given a connected mailbox and a contact whose `email`/`contact_emails` includes `alice@x.com`, when Alice sends a new email to the shared mailbox and the push (or poll) is processed, then a new `inbound` item appears in Alice's Pulse timeline in chronological position, `contacts.has_unread` and her `timelines.has_unread` become true, and an open Pulse updates live. The same email is **not** duplicated if the push and the 5-min poll both process it.
- **AC-2 (draft/sent/own excluded — no push storm).** Given the agent composes and **saves a Gmail draft** (and later edits it) addressed to a contact, when the resulting `messagesAdded`/`labelsAdded` history is processed, then **no timeline entry and no unread** are produced for that contact. A message with `labelIds` containing `SENT` or whose `from` = the mailbox address never creates an inbound timeline entry.
- **AC-3 (no-match stays in inbox only).** Given an inbound email from `nobody@unknown.com` that matches **no** contact in the company, when processed, then it appears in the standalone EMAIL-001 inbox and **no** timeline entry / unread / contact is created.
- **AC-4 (quote stripping).** Given an inbound reply whose body contains the new line `Sounds good, Tuesday works` followed by `On Mon, … <agent@co.com> wrote:` and `>`-quoted prior thread, then the **timeline** shows `Sounds good, Tuesday works` (+ signature if present) and **not** the quoted history; the full original remains intact in the inbox view.
- **AC-5 (reply threads correctly).** Given a contact with an existing inbound email thread, when the agent replies from the Pulse composer with the email target selected, then Gmail sends in the **same thread** (`threadId` + `In-Reply-To`/`References` set), the subject is `Re: <thread subject>`, and the outbound message appears in the timeline linked to that contact.
- **AC-6 (initiate new thread).** Given a contact with **no** prior email thread, when the agent selects the contact's email and sends, then a **new** Gmail thread is created with an auto subject (no subject field shown), and the outbound email appears in the timeline.
- **AC-7 (channel selection).** In the "To" selector, choosing a phone sends **SMS** (unchanged path) and choosing an email sends **email**; the two never cross. With no email selected/available, the composer behaves exactly as today (SMS-only).
- **AC-8 (default channel = last inbound).** Given the contact's most recent inbound activity is an email, the composer opens with the **email** target preselected; given it is an SMS, it opens with the SMS target (existing last-used-phone). 
- **AC-9 (not-connected CTA).** Given the company has no connected mailbox, the email entry in the selector shows the connect CTA copy, is not a selectable send target, and links to the email settings/connect page; selecting a phone still sends SMS normally.
- **AC-10 (permissions + tenancy).** A user lacking `messages.send` cannot send timeline email (403, mirroring SMS/compose). An inbound email for company A never appears in company B's timeline or inbox. The push endpoint rejects a notification with a missing/invalid token (4xx, no processing).
- **AC-11 (watch lifecycle + poll fallback).** A mailbox's `users.watch` is renewed before its expiry by the renewal scheduler; if a single push is dropped, the next 5-minute poll reconciles the missed inbound message into the timeline (idempotently, no duplicate).
- **AC-12 (provider seam).** `buildTimeline` and the inbound contact-matching/exchange service contain **no** `googleapis`/Gmail-specific imports — they call the `MailProvider`/exchange abstraction. Gmail specifics live only in `GmailProvider` + EMAIL-001 services.
- **AC-13 (backwards-compat).** The standalone `/email` inbox (list, thread detail, search, attachments, compose/reply, settings, OAuth) is byte-for-behavior unchanged; EMAIL-001 acceptance criteria still hold. The 5-minute scheduler still runs. No SMS/calls/financial timeline behavior changes.

### Constraints / non-functional

- **Idempotency** is mandatory: Pub/Sub delivers **at-least-once** and the poll overlaps it; inbound→timeline linkage and unread must be safe under duplicate/redelivered/reordered history (keyed on `(company_id, provider_message_id)`).
- Push endpoint must **ack fast** (return 2xx within Pub/Sub's deadline) and do sync work async, to avoid Pub/Sub retry storms.
- Gmail `users.watch` **expires ≤7 days**; renewal cadence must be well inside that (≤24h interval).
- Plain-text-only + quote-stripping must be **deterministic** and must not mutate the stored `email_messages` body (inbox parity).
- No regression to EMAIL-001 token-refresh, sync-state, or scheduler behavior.

### Affected modules

- **Backend:** new mail-provider abstraction + Gmail impl; new email-timeline exchange/contact-matching service; new Pub/Sub push route (raw-body, verified, mounted before `express.json`); watch + renewal lifecycle; `buildTimeline` extension in `backend/src/routes/pulse.js`; new outbound timeline-email route; `emailSyncService` history hook to invoke contact-matching; `emailQueries` additions.
- **Frontend:** `SmsForm.tsx` "To" selector (phones + emails + CTA), `usePulsePage.ts` channel routing + default-channel, `messagingApi/emailApi` email-send-from-timeline call, new email timeline item type + bubble in `PulseTimeline.tsx`/`SmsListItem.tsx`.
- **DB:** migration `129` linking email messages to a contact/timeline + the projection `buildTimeline` reads; watch-lifecycle columns on `email_mailboxes`.

### Affected integrations

- **Google / Gmail API** (`users.watch`, `users.history.list`, `users.messages.send` — all already used by EMAIL-001) + **Google Cloud Pub/Sub** (new: topic + push subscription to our endpoint). No Twilio/Front/Zenbooker/Stripe change.

### Protected (must not break)

- **EMAIL-001 standalone inbox** — `email.js` routes, `components/email/*`, `EmailPage`, search, attachments, OAuth, settings, the 5-minute scheduler.
- **EMAIL-001 services** — do not alter `getValidAccessToken`/token-refresh, `importGmailThread` thread-upsert semantics, or `email_sync_state` checkpointing in a way that breaks the inbox; extend via hooks/new functions.
- **SMS/calls/financial timeline** — existing `buildTimeline` outputs (`calls`, `messages`, `conversations`, `financial_events`) and SMS send path stay intact; email is **additive**.
- **slot-engine**, `src/server.js` core boot, `authedFetch.ts`, `useRealtimeEvents.ts`, and `backend/db/` existing migrations (079 etc.) — unchanged (new migration only).
- Multi-tenant isolation: no query may drop the `company_id` filter.

# SEND-DOC-001 — Send Estimate & Invoice by Email/SMS + Gmail-as-Marketplace-App

> Status: requirements (Product 01). Two coupled parts. **PART A** = actually deliver Estimates & Invoices to the client (today both "send" actions are stubs / record-only — no email or SMS ever leaves the system). **PART B** = move the Gmail connect/disconnect UI out of `/settings/email` and into a first-class **marketplace app** ("Google Email"), and retire the standalone settings page.

## 1. Problem

Operators can build a polished Estimate or Invoice (line items, branded PDF, "Preview PDF") but **cannot get it to the customer from inside Albusto**. Concretely:

- **Estimate "Send"** opens a stub dialog that only picks a channel and calls `estimatesService.sendEstimate`, which logs a `send_stub_requested` event and changes **nothing** — no status change, no email, no SMS, no public link. There is **no public estimate page** at all (estimates have no `public_token`, no public route, no view page).
- **Invoice "Send"** has a fully-built dialog (channel, editable recipient, message, "include payment link") and flips the invoice to `sent`/`sent_at`, but the service comment says it plainly: *"MVP: record the delivery, no actual sending."* No email or SMS is dispatched. The customer never receives anything.
- All the **delivery infrastructure already exists but is unwired**: `emailService.sendEmail` (multipart Gmail send with PDF attachments), `conversationsService.getOrCreateConversation` + `sendMessage` (wallet-gated Twilio SMS), `generatePdf` for both docs, and `ensurePublicLink` + the branded pay page (`/pay/:token`) for invoices.
- Separately, **Gmail connection lives in its own settings page** (`/settings/email` + a nav item) that duplicates what the marketplace is for. Other apps (`mail-secretary`) already depend on a connected Gmail and deep-link to `/settings/email`. The customer wants Gmail managed like every other integration (in the marketplace) and the standalone page removed.

The result: the sales→delivery loop is broken at the last step, and integration settings are inconsistent.

## 2. Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**
- Send an Estimate or Invoice to the client by **Email** (PDF attached + link to the online doc) or **SMS** (text + link, no attachment), from the existing detail panels.
- Give estimates the same **public, tokenized, branded online page** invoices have — a **view-only** estimate page at `/e/<token>` plus a public PDF endpoint.
- **Actually dispatch**: wire `sendEstimate`/`sendInvoice` to `emailService.sendEmail` (email) and `conversationsService` SMS; flip status → `sent` + `sent_at`; record the send event; ensure the activity lands on the **contact timeline**.
- Enforce correct **gating**: doc authority (`estimates.send`/`invoices.send`), a connected Gmail mailbox for email (else a clear "connect" path), an active wallet + a company Twilio number for SMS, and a present recipient.
- Move Gmail connect/disconnect/status into a new **"Google Email" marketplace app** that **reuses the existing Google OAuth backend**, and **remove the `/settings/email` route and nav item**; update the OAuth callback redirect and every `/settings/email` reference (incl. `mail-secretary`'s `dependency_cta`) to the new destination.

**Non-goals (v1)**
- Estimate **Accept/Decline from the public page** (the page is view-only in v1; approve/decline stays operator-side). The public estimate page is structured to add it later.
- Online payment **on the estimate page** (payment stays an invoice concept via the existing `/pay/:token`).
- Rewriting the Google OAuth flow, the email inbox (EMAIL-001), or the timeline projection (EMAIL-TIMELINE-001) — those are **reused**, only the entry point and a thin dispatch/stamp call are added.
- Scheduled/automated sending, delivery-receipt tracking beyond what Twilio/Gmail already record, multi-recipient/CC UI.

## 3. User stories

- **US-1** As an operator, from the Estimate detail panel I click **Send**, pick **Email** or **SMS**, confirm/edit the recipient and a prefilled message, and the customer receives the estimate (email: branded PDF + link; SMS: text + link).
- **US-2** As an operator, the same works for an Invoice (it already has the richer dialog), and an "include payment link" choice controls whether the pay link is embedded.
- **US-3** As a customer, I receive a link and open a **branded online estimate page** (or the existing invoice pay page) without logging in.
- **US-4** As an operator, after I send, the doc shows **Sent** with a timestamp, and the send appears on the **contact's timeline** (the email I sent / the SMS I sent), so the whole team sees it.
- **US-5** As an operator without a connected mailbox, when I try to send by email I get a clear message and a **one-click path to connect Google Email** (the marketplace app), not a dead end.
- **US-6** As an operator without wallet balance or without a company sending number, SMS send fails with a clear, specific reason and **no** false "Sent" state.
- **US-7** As an admin, I connect/disconnect **Google Email from the marketplace** (`/settings/integrations`), like Stripe or VAPI; the standalone `/settings/email` page is gone, and old links/bookmarks redirect to the marketplace.
- **US-8** As an admin, the "Google Email" app shows **Connected** with the actual mailbox address only when a Gmail mailbox is truly connected (derived from the real mailbox status, not just an install row).

## 4. Functional requirements

### PART A — Send Estimate/Invoice

**FR-A1 Estimate public link + page.**
- Add `estimates.public_token` (nullable TEXT, unique partial index), minted lazily by `estimatesService.ensurePublicLink(companyId, id)` (mirror invoice: `crypto.randomBytes(8).toString('base64url')`, idempotent).
- Public, unauthenticated routes (token is the credential): view-data `GET /api/public/estimates/:token`, PDF `GET /api/public/estimates/:token/pdf`, and a short alias `GET /e/:token` (302 → the React page, mirroring how `/i/:token` and `/pay/:token` are served). The link embedded in messages is `(PUBLIC_APP_URL||APP_URL)/e/<token>`.
- A **branded, view-only** React page at `/e/:token` (`PublicEstimateViewPage`, mirroring `PublicInvoicePayPage`): company name, estimate number, line items/totals, status, a "Download PDF" action. No Accept/Decline, no payment in v1.

**FR-A2 Channel semantics.**
- **Email** = the document **PDF attached** + a **link to the online doc** in the body (estimate → `/e/<token>`; invoice → `/pay/<token>`).
- **SMS** = a short text **+ the link** (no attachment); wallet-gated.

**FR-A3 Send dialog (estimate parity).**
- Upgrade `EstimateSendDialog` to match the built `InvoiceSendDialog`: channel **email | SMS** toggle, editable recipient (email vs phone), required message prefilled from contact + a default per-doc/per-channel template, and the public link minted on open (`ensureEstimatePublicLink`). Invoice keeps its dialog (incl. "include payment link").
- `EstimateSendData` extends to `{ channel: 'email'|'sms', recipient: string, message: string }` (today it is only `{ channel }`).

**FR-A4 Real dispatch + status + timeline.**
- `sendEstimate`/`sendInvoice` accept `{ channel, recipient, message }`, then:
  - **Email**: `generatePdf` → `ensurePublicLink` → `emailService.sendEmail(companyId, { to: recipient, subject, body(html, incl. link), files:[{ originalname, mimetype:'application/pdf', buffer }], userId, userEmail })`. After send, **stamp the contact timeline** by linking the returned `provider_message_id` to the doc's contact (the EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 outbound linking — `emailQueries.linkMessageToContact(provider_message_id, companyId, { contact_id, timeline_id, on_timeline:true })`).
  - **SMS**: resolve `proxyE164` (company Twilio number) → `getOrCreateConversation(customerE164, proxyE164, companyId)` → `sendMessage(convId, { body: text+link, author:'agent' })` (wallet gate is inside `sendMessage`; `conversationsService` already records the message and projects SMS to the timeline).
- On success: flip status → `sent` and set `sent_at` (estimate gains this; invoice already does), and record the existing send **event** (`sent`) with channel/recipient. On any dispatch failure: status is **not** changed.

**FR-A5 Gating & errors (exact contracts).**
- Authority: `estimates.send` / `invoices.send` (unchanged route perms).
- **Recipient missing** → `400` (block) with a clear message; dialog disables Send when empty (already the invoice behavior).
- **Email, mailbox not connected** → `409 MAILBOX_NOT_CONNECTED` (derive from mailbox status before sending; `emailService.sendEmail` itself throws `409` on `reconnect_required`). UI surfaces the **connect CTA → the Google Email marketplace app** (FR-A6), not `/settings/email`.
- **SMS, wallet blocked** → `402` (`WALLET_BLOCKED` from `assertServiceActive`) surfaced as "Messaging is paused — top up your balance."
- **SMS, no company Twilio number** (`resolveCompanyProxyE164` → null) → `422 NO_PROXY` "No sending number configured for your company." (mirror the ETA-notify contract); no side effects.
- **SMS, no/invalid customer phone** → `422 NO_PHONE`.

**FR-A6 Connect CTA target.** When email send is blocked for "not connected", the surfaced hint/link points to the **new Google Email marketplace app** (its setup path under `/settings/integrations`), never to the removed `/settings/email`.

**FR-A7 Financials-tab reuse fix.** `JobFinancialsTab` and `LeadFinancialsTab` currently call `sendInvoice(id, { channel:'email', recipient:'' })` directly from `InvoiceDetailPanel.onSend`, **bypassing the dialog** (empty recipient → would now fail FR-A5). Route these through `InvoiceSendDialog` (and `EstimateSendDialog` for estimates) so the operator always confirms recipient/message.

### PART B — Gmail connect → marketplace app

**FR-B1 New marketplace app.** Seed a published `marketplace_apps` row, key **`google-email`**, name **"Google Email"** (category `communication`/`ai`, `app_type` `internal`, `provisioning_mode` `none`), with `metadata.setup_path` pointing at its destination under `/settings/integrations` (mirror the Stripe/VAPI seed pattern). The app represents the company's Gmail connection.

**FR-B2 Connect via existing OAuth.** The app's "Connect" action triggers the **existing** Google OAuth (`POST /api/settings/email/google/start` → Google consent → `GET /api/email/oauth/google/callback`). The OAuth backend (`email-settings.js`, `email-oauth.js`, `emailMailboxService`) is **reused unchanged** — only the frontend entry point and the post-callback redirect move.

**FR-B3 Connected-state derived from the real mailbox.** The "Google Email" app's connected state and the displayed address **derive from the actual Gmail mailbox** (the same source as `GET /api/email/timeline/mailbox-status` → `{ connected, email_address }` / `getMailboxSettings` → `{ provider:'gmail', status:'connected', email_address }`), **not** merely from a `marketplace_installations` row. (The marketplace list query/resolver must overlay mailbox status for this app so "Connected ✓ name@domain" reflects reality.)

**FR-B4 Disconnect.** The app supports disconnect, which calls the existing `POST /api/settings/email/disconnect` (tears down the Gmail watch, nulls tokens, preserves synced history) — reused, not reimplemented.

**FR-B5 Remove the standalone page.** Delete the `/settings/email` **route** (App.tsx:142) and the **nav item** (`appLayoutNavigation.tsx:96`). The connect/disconnect/status UI lives in the marketplace (a dedicated app detail/setup surface under `/settings/integrations`, mirroring Stripe/VAPI setup pages, OR the existing `MarketplaceConnectDialog` "connect Gmail" pattern). Old `/settings/email` URLs (bookmarks, the OAuth callback) must **redirect** to the new destination, not 404.

**FR-B6 Update callback redirect + all references.** Change the OAuth callback redirect (`email-oauth.js`: `/settings/email?...` success/`?error=`/`?email_error=...`) to the new marketplace destination (with equivalent success/error query flags). Update `mail-secretary`'s `metadata.dependency_cta.path` (currently `/settings/email`) and every other `/settings/email` reference in the frontend (`appLayoutNavigation`, `SmsForm`, `EmailThreadPane`, `EmailPage`, `IntegrationsPage`, `emailApi`) to the new app path.

**FR-B7 Status source for the send dialog is unchanged.** The send-dialog connection check still uses `getTimelineMailboxStatus` (`{ connected, email_address }`) — no behavior change there; only the **CTA destination** changes (FR-A6).

## 5. Acceptance criteria

**PART A**
- **AC-1** From the Estimate detail panel, **Send → Email** with a valid recipient delivers a Gmail email **with the estimate PDF attached** and a body containing the `/e/<token>` link; the estimate flips to **Sent** with `sent_at`; a `sent` event is recorded; the sent email appears on the **contact timeline**.
- **AC-2** From the Estimate panel, **Send → SMS** with a valid phone sends a Twilio SMS containing the `/e/<token>` link (no attachment); status → **Sent**; the SMS appears on the contact timeline.
- **AC-3** Opening `/e/<token>` in a fresh browser (no auth) renders the **branded, view-only** estimate (number, items, totals) and a working **Download PDF**; `GET /api/public/estimates/:token/pdf` returns the PDF; `GET /e/:badtoken` (malformed) returns 404.
- **AC-4** Invoice **Send → Email** delivers the invoice **PDF + `/pay/<token>` link**; **Send → SMS** sends text + link; "include payment link" toggles whether the link is embedded; status → **Sent**; activity lands on the timeline. (`sendInvoice` no longer merely records.)
- **AC-5** Email send with **no connected mailbox** returns `409 MAILBOX_NOT_CONNECTED`; the UI shows a connect hint linking to the **Google Email marketplace app** (not `/settings/email`); status is unchanged.
- **AC-6** SMS send with **wallet blocked** → `402`; with **no company Twilio number** → `422 NO_PROXY`; with **no/invalid recipient phone** → `422 NO_PHONE`. In every failure the doc is **not** marked Sent.
- **AC-7** Sending with an **empty recipient** is blocked (Send disabled; backend `400` if forced) for both docs.
- **AC-8** `JobFinancialsTab` / `LeadFinancialsTab` open the proper **send dialog** (recipient prefilled from `contact_email`/`contact_phone`) instead of calling `sendInvoice` with an empty recipient; sending from a job/lead works end-to-end.

**PART B**
- **AC-9** `/settings/integrations` lists a **"Google Email"** app. With no mailbox connected it shows **Not connected** + a Connect action; clicking Connect runs the existing Google OAuth and returns to the marketplace.
- **AC-10** After OAuth, the "Google Email" app shows **Connected** with the **actual mailbox address**, derived from the real mailbox status (disconnecting the mailbox flips it back to Not connected even though an install row may exist).
- **AC-11** **Disconnect** from the app calls the existing disconnect endpoint (watch torn down, tokens nulled, history preserved) and the app returns to Not connected.
- **AC-12** The **`/settings/email` nav item is gone** and the route no longer renders the old page; navigating to `/settings/email` (old bookmark) **redirects** to the new marketplace destination.
- **AC-13** The OAuth **callback redirect** lands on the new marketplace destination (with success/error flags preserved); `mail-secretary`'s `dependency_cta` and all other `/settings/email` references now point to the new app.
- **AC-14** `mail-secretary`'s "Connect Gmail before enabling…" gate still works, now resolving connected-state from the same mailbox source and linking to the new app.

**Regression / protected**
- **AC-15** EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 inbound/outbound email projection and the standalone `/email` inbox are byte-for-behavior unchanged; the Google OAuth backend (`email-settings.js`, `email-oauth.js`, `emailMailboxService`, token refresh, Gmail watch) is unchanged except the callback redirect URL.
- **AC-16** The existing **invoice pay page** (`/pay/:token`), `ensureInvoicePublicLink`, `/i/:token`, and Stripe public-pay routes are unchanged; the new estimate public routes are **additive** (new `/api/public/estimates/*` + `/e/:token`), not a refactor of the invoice ones.
- **AC-17** Multi-tenant isolation holds: public token lookups are unscoped-by-design (token is the credential) but resolve a single row; all authenticated paths keep the `company_id` filter.

## 6. Protected / do-not-break

- **EMAIL-TIMELINE-001** send/receive + timeline projection; **EMAIL-001** inbox, search, attachments, the 5-min scheduler.
- The **Google OAuth backend** (`routes/email-settings.js`, `routes/email-oauth.js`, `services/emailMailboxService.js`) — reuse; only the callback redirect string changes.
- The **invoice pay page** + invoice public token/route/short-link + Stripe public-pay endpoints.
- `crypto.randomBytes` token scheme + the unique partial index pattern (mirror, don't alter, the invoice one).
- Wallet gating (`walletService.assertServiceActive`) and `resolveCompanyProxyE164` contract (422 on missing proxy).
- `src/server.js` public-router mount order (auth-skipping `/api/public/*` + `/i/:token`); the new estimate public router mounts alongside the same way.

## GOOGLE-SSO-FIX-001: "Continue with Google" fix + account-architecture hardening

**Status:** Implemented (pending deploy) · **Priority:** P0 · **Area:** Auth (Keycloak) / Frontend / Onboarding
**Spec:** `Docs/specs/GOOGLE-SSO-FIX-001.md`

### Description
Fix the non-working **Continue with Google** button on `/signup` (console
`TypeError … reading 'login'`). Root cause is the frontend calling Keycloak
`login()` on an uninitialized instance (no adapter, no PKCE) — the prod `google`
IdP itself works. Also: pull full name + email (and split given/family) from Google,
codify the drifted Keycloak IdP config in git, auto-link on verified email, and add
the Google button to the sign-in page.

### User scenarios
1. New user clicks **Continue with Google** on `/signup` → redirected to Google →
   returns to `/onboarding` authenticated; `crm_users` gets `full_name`+`email` from Google.
2. Google user whose email already has a password account → auto-linked (no manual prompt).
3. Existing user clicks **Continue with Google** on the sign-in page → logs in.
4. Google user completes onboarding: phone → SMS OTP (kept) → company creation.

### Constraints / non-functional
- No DB migration (given/family live in Keycloak; no avatar column). `picture`/`locale` not consumed.
- Secrets never in git — realm export uses `${GOOGLE_IDP_CLIENT_ID/SECRET}`.
- Realm import does not reconfigure the existing prod realm → apply via `scripts/setup-google-idp.sh`.
- Email/password signup + existing password sign-in unchanged.

### Involved modules
- Frontend: `auth/AuthProvider.tsx`, `pages/auth/SignupPage.tsx` (`OnboardingPage.tsx` verified, unchanged).
- Keycloak: `keycloak/realm-export.json`, `keycloak-themes/albusto/login/{login.ftl,resources/css/albusto-login.css}`, `scripts/setup-google-idp.sh`.
- Backend (unchanged, relied upon): `middleware/keycloakAuth.js` → `services/userService.findOrCreateUser`, `routes/onboarding.js`.

### Integrations
- Google OIDC (via Keycloak broker). No Twilio/Front/Zenbooker impact (SMS OTP path reused as-is).

### Protected parts (must not break)
- `src/server.js`, `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`, `useRealtimeEvents.ts`, `backend/db/` — untouched.
- JIT provisioning contract in `userService.findOrCreateUser` (upsert by `keycloak_sub`) — relied upon, not modified.

## ONBOARD-FIX-001: tenant-isolation leak + onboarding access + phone mask + theme audit

**Status:** Implemented (pending deploy) · **Priority:** P0 (SEC) · **Area:** Auth / Frontend onboarding / Keycloak theme
**Spec:** `Docs/specs/ONBOARD-FIX-001.md` · Follow-up to GOOGLE-SSO-FIX-001

### Description
Four parts: (SEC) close a cross-tenant leak where a user with no active membership resolved
to the seed company via the `crm_users.company_id` shadow fallback + a mig-012 backfill;
(A) fix onboarding landing on "You don't have access here" + a redirect flicker (stale authz
context after company creation); (B) mask the onboarding phone field like the New Lead card;
(C) theme the reachable Keycloak pages that fell back to unstyled base markup.

### User scenarios
1. New user finishes onboarding → lands on THEIR company's Pulse, no flicker, no false 403.
2. A user with no active membership can NOT read any other company's data (403).
3. Onboarding phone masks to `(617) 555-0142`; OTP sent/verified in E.164.
4. OTP / method-picker / password-reset / error / review-profile pages render branded.

### Constraints / non-functional
- Tenant scope is membership-only; `crm_users.company_id` is not consulted for access.
- Dev auth bypass must fail closed in production.
- Migration 140 is idempotent and logs the affected row count.
- No token-shape change; `refreshAuthz` avoids a hard reload (keeps the 401→2FA-loop guard).

### Involved modules
- Backend: `middleware/keycloakAuth.js` (`requireCompanyAccess`, `authenticate`), migration 140. Verify-only: `authorizationService.resolveAuthzContext`, `platformCompanyService.bootstrapCompany`.
- Frontend: `auth/AuthProvider.tsx` (`refreshAuthz`), `pages/auth/OnboardingPage.tsx`. Reuse: `components/ui/PhoneInput` (`formatUSPhone`/`toE164`).
- Keycloak theme: 6 new `.ftl` templates.

### Integrations
- SMS OTP (phone now E.164). No Twilio/Front/Zenbooker behavior change.

### Protected parts
- `src/server.js`, `authedFetch.ts`, `useRealtimeEvents.ts` untouched. `backend/db/` only via migration 140 (additive/idempotent, per plan).

## LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001: "new leads" counter badge in navigation

**Status:** Implemented (pending deploy) · **Priority:** P1 · **Area:** Frontend nav + Leads backend
**Spec:** `Docs/specs/LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001.md`

### Description
Badge (number in a circle, like the Pulse new-events badge) on the Leads nav item = company's count
of new/unactioned leads (`status ∈ {Submitted, New, Review}`, `lead_lost=false`). No read/unread —
status-derived, persists until leads are actioned. Company-scoped; hybrid freshness (mount +
route-change + 60s poll + SSE `lead.created`/`lead.updated`).

### User scenarios
1. New lead created (any path) → Leads badge increments live for that company.
2. Lead actioned (contacted/lost/converted) → badge decrements.
3. Opening Leads does NOT clear the badge.

### Constraints
- Company-scoped count; visibility follows `leads.view`. SSE payload PII-free; client filters by company_id.
- No migration (indexes + `lead_lost` exist). No new permission.
- `/new-count` route MUST precede `/:uuid`.

### Involved modules
- `leadsService` (`countNewLeads`, `NEW_LEAD_STATUSES`, emits), `routes/leads.js`, `realtimeService`.
- `AppLayout.tsx`, `appLayoutNavigation.tsx`, `useRealtimeEvents.ts` (additive), `AppLayout.css`.

### Protected parts
- `useRealtimeEvents.ts` touched **additively** (two event types added to the generic channel), per approved plan. No backend/db schema change.

## PRICEBOOK-001: Price Book (Category → Group → Item)

**Status:** Implemented (pending deploy) · **Area:** Estimates/Invoices catalog / Settings · **Spec:** `Docs/specs/PRICEBOOK-001.md`

### Description
A 3-level catalog for estimate/invoice line items: Categories (grouping only), Groups (expand into
their Items when added to a doc), Items (`estimate_item_presets` extended). Standalone
**Settings → Price Book** editor + picker integration (pick a group → its items are inserted).

### User scenarios
1. Manage Items/Groups/Categories in Settings → Price Book (create/edit/archive).
2. A group holds several items with per-item quantities; selecting it in an estimate/invoice inserts all items.
3. Items and groups can be organized under categories.

### Constraints
- Manage = admin+manager (`price_book.manage`); use = any doc-editing role (`price_book.view`).
- Company-scoped; snapshot semantics; group expansion skips archived items. Migration 141.

### Involved modules
- Backend: migration 141, `priceBookQueries`/`priceBookService`, extended `estimateItemPresets*`, `routes/price-book.js`, bulk endpoints on estimates/invoices, `permissionCatalog.js`, `050`.
- Frontend: `PriceBookPage`, `priceBookApi`, extended `ItemPresetSearchCombobox` + Estimate/Invoice panels, nav/route/dev-perms.

### Protected parts
- No protected file broken. `backend/db/` only via migration 141 (idempotent, additive).

## PRICEBOOK-002: Items grid — inline spreadsheet editing

**Status:** Implemented (verified local; pending deploy) · **Area:** Settings → Price Book / Items tab · **Spec:** `Docs/specs/PRICEBOOK-002.md`

### Description
Replace the "list row + right-side slide-over editor per item" model on the **Items & products** tab with a
**spreadsheet-style editable grid**: every cell of every item is edited inline (Name, Description, Code/SKU,
Unit, Unit Price, Taxable, Category), a **"+" row** pinned at the end starts a new empty item, and the whole
table is persisted at once via a **single Save button** (atomic bulk save). No per-item slide-over on this tab.
Groups and Categories tabs are unchanged.

### User scenarios
1. Manager opens Settings → Price Book → Items and sees all items as an editable grid.
2. She edits several cells across several rows (price, taxable, category, name…) without opening any panel.
3. She clicks the "+" at the end of the list, a blank row appears, she types a new item inline.
4. She marks a row for deletion with a per-row trash icon (undo-able before saving).
5. She clicks **Save changes** once; all creates/edits/deletes commit atomically; the grid re-hydrates.
6. She types in Search to filter the visible rows client-side; her unsaved edits are preserved.
7. If she navigates away with unsaved changes, she is warned.

### Functional requirements
- Inline-editable cells for all 7 item fields; Description is a single-line cell that expands to ≥3 lines
  (or fits content) on focus and collapses on blur; Taxable is a checkbox;
  Category is an inline select of existing (non-archived) categories.
- Trailing "+ add row" affordance always visible; adds a blank draft row.
- Single **Save changes** button, enabled only when the grid is dirty; a **Discard** reverts to server state.
- Atomic bulk persistence via `PUT /api/price-book/items/bulk` (create/update/archive in one transaction);
  all-or-nothing — a validation error rejects the whole save with a per-row reason and commits nothing.
- Validation: name required on every non-deleted row; price numeric ≥ 0; category must belong to the company
  or be empty; fully-empty new rows are ignored (not an error).
- Client-side Search filters loaded rows only (no refetch); dirty edits survive filtering.

### Constraints
- Manage-only (`price_book.manage`); company-scoped on every statement; a row id from another company must
  not be updatable/deletable (foreign id → rejected). No new migration (reuses `estimate_item_presets`).
- Bulk update must NOT clobber columns the grid doesn't edit; archiving here must not break the estimate/invoice
  inline item picker that shares `estimate_item_presets`.
- **Documented exception to the "right-side layer" canon**: inline table editing is allowed here, but Blanc
  tokens / fonts / "no decorative horizontal separators" still apply.

### Involved modules
- Backend: `estimateItemPresetsService` (new `bulkSaveItems`), `estimateItemPresetsQueries` (tx helper),
  `routes/price-book.js` (`PUT /items/bulk`). No migration, no new permission.
- Frontend: `PriceBookPage` (`ItemsTab` rewritten to a grid; `ItemPanel` dropped from the Items flow),
  `priceBookApi` (`bulkSaveItems`).

### Protected parts
- No protected file touched. No `backend/db/` change.

## Фича ONBTEL-001: Онбординг новой компании → Marketplace-приложение «Telephony — Twilio» → фиксы изоляции Twilio

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P0 · **Date:** 2026-07-02 · **Owner:** Platform / Telephony / Billing
**Тип:** одна зонтичная фича из трёх связанных частей (A/B/C). Продукт для пользователя — **Albusto** (никакого "Blanc" в UI-тексте).
**Решения владельца зафиксированы интервью и являются ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНЫМИ** (не пересматривать на этапах Architect/Planner).

**Краткое описание:** Первый пользователь новой tenant-компании (владелец, `role_key='tenant_admin'`) после регистрации видит на `/pulse` расширяемый чеклист-онбординг с единственным пока пунктом «Подключить телефонию»; сам процесс подключения телефонии переезжает из прямого входа `/settings/telephony` в Marketplace-приложение «Telephony — Twilio» с трёхшаговым Connect-визардом (субаккаунт → тариф, включая НОВЫЙ поминутный план Pay-as-you-go → покупка номера); параллельно закрываются все 5 найденных аудитом дыр изоляции Twilio (unknown-number reject, NOT NULL/UNIQUE в схеме номеров, wallet-гейт до роутинга, fail-closed softphone token).

### Проверка на дублирование (результат)

Дублей нет — ONBTEL-001 **расширяет** существующие фичи, а не повторяет их:

- **ALB-107 (Multi-tenant Telephony — Twilio Subaccounts)** — уже даёт connect-субаккаунт / поиск / покупку / release номеров и webhook-маршрутизацию по `AccountSid`→`To`. Часть B **переносит точку входа** в Marketplace и добавляет шаг тарифа; сами API переиспользуются. Часть C — фиксы изоляции внутри той же подсистемы. Расширение, не дубль.
- **F016 (VAPI marketplace) / F018 (Stripe Payments marketplace) / SEND-DOC-001 Part B (Google Email marketplace)** — канон «плитка → отдельная страница настройки `/settings/integrations/<app>` → seed в `marketplace_apps` → install/disconnect через `/api/marketplace/*`». Часть B добавляет **новое** приложение по этому канону; канон не меняется.
- **BILLING-UI / ADR-001 (платформенный биллинг)** — планы trial/starter/pro/huge, Stripe checkout, wallet (миграции 101/103/107/108/109) существуют. Часть B добавляет **новый план** «Pay-as-you-go» поверх существующей модели планов/кошелька и переиспользует существующий checkout для пакетов. Расширение, не дубль.
- **ALB-101 / ONBOARD-FIX-001 (signup/онбординг)** — signup → `/onboarding` → `POST /api/onboarding` → `bootstrapCompany` не меняется; Часть A добавляет чеклист **после** этого флоу. Чеклиста/флага «свежая компания» сегодня не существует (проверено).
- **F017 (call flow) и TELEPHONY-AUTONOMOUS-MODE-001** — не изменяются, попадают в защищённые части.
- Существующих аналогов нет: в системе нет ни онбординг-чеклиста на `/pulse`, ни marketplace-приложения телефонии (сегодня 5 приложений: mail-secretary, vapi-ai, stripe-payments, call-qa-agent, lead-generator), ни поминутного плана, ни Reject для неизвестных номеров.

### Часть A — Онбординг-чеклист новой tenant-компании на `/pulse`

**Описание:** Большая карточка-чеклист **на всю ширину, В ПОТОКЕ страницы** `/pulse` (сдвигает контент вниз; НЕ оверлей/модалка). Пока один пункт: «Подключить телефонию» → ведёт на карточку/визард Marketplace-приложения «Telephony — Twilio». Чеклист — **данные, не хардкод** (расширяемая модель пунктов). Видна только `tenant_admin`. Живёт до выполнения всех пунктов; допускается свернуть (collapse), но полностью скрыть нельзя. Пункт телефонии считается выполненным, когда у компании есть **≥1 активный купленный номер**. Email-пункт НЕ делать.

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. Владелец новой компании завершает регистрацию и онбординг (`/signup` → `/onboarding` → `POST /api/onboarding` → `bootstrapCompany`) и попадает на `/pulse`: вверху страницы — полноширинная карточка-чеклист с пунктом «Подключить телефонию» (не выполнен) и переходом в Marketplace-приложение «Telephony — Twilio»; контент Pulse сдвинут вниз, ничего не перекрыто.
2. Владелец сворачивает чеклист: карточка складывается в компактную строку (заголовок + прогресс), состояние сохраняется между визитами/сессиями; полного скрытия/dismiss нет, пока пункты не выполнены.
3. Владелец проходит визард Части B и покупает номер: при следующем открытии `/pulse` пункт отмечен выполненным автоматически (derived-статус, не ручная галочка); когда все пункты выполнены — карточка исчезает насовсем.
4. Сотрудник той же компании с ролью manager/dispatcher/provider открывает `/pulse` — чеклист не отображается вовсе (гейт по `tenant_admin` и на фронте через `useAuthz().isTenantAdmin()`, и на backend-эндпоинте состояния).
5. Пользователь существующей компании с уже купленными номерами (в т.ч. Boston Masters, seed 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001) открывает `/pulse` — чеклист не отображается (критерий выполнен по данным), поведение страницы не меняется.

### Часть B — Marketplace-приложение «Telephony — Twilio» (Connect-визард с шагом тарифа)

**Описание:** Подключение телефонии переезжает из прямого `/settings/telephony`-входа в Marketplace (Settings → Integrations): новая плитка приложения → Connect-**визард** из трёх шагов: (1) создание Twilio-субаккаунта — существующий флоу `POST /api/telephony/numbers/connect` (`company_telephony`, mig 098); (2) **шаг тарифа**: «Поминутно (Pay-as-you-go)» = **новый** billing-план ($0/мес, 0 включённых минут, списание с кошелька по ставкам владельца: $0.04/мин звонки, $0.03/SMS) ИЛИ «Пакет» = выбор существующих планов starter/pro/huge через существующий Stripe checkout — выбор **реально применяется** к биллингу компании через существующий `billingService`; (3) поиск и покупка номера — существующие search/buy API (лимит номеров по плану). Существующий раздел Settings → Telephony **остаётся** как управление уже подключённой телефонией (номера, группы, флоу). Существующие компании считаются connected — их поведение не меняется.

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. `tenant_admin` открывает Settings → Integrations, видит плитку «Telephony — Twilio» (Available), нажимает Connect/Configure и попадает на страницу-визард `/settings/integrations/telephony-twilio` (по канону страниц VAPI/Stripe Payments).
2. Шаг 1 «Подключение»: создаётся Twilio-субаккаунт через существующий connect-флоу; статус отображается; повторный вход в визард после успешного подключения не создаёт второй субаккаунт (идемпотентность существующего флоу сохраняется, подкреплена UNIQUE из Части C).
3. Шаг 2 «Тариф»: выбор «Поминутно (Pay-as-you-go)» применяет к компании новый план ($0/мес, 0 включённых минут; звонки $0.04/мин, SMS $0.03 — списываются с существующего кошелька, mig 109: мин. пополнение $10, floor −$5); выбор «Пакет» (starter $49 / pro $149 / huge $289) запускает существующий Stripe checkout и после возврата подписка активна. Выбор фиксируется в биллинге компании — это не декоративный шаг.
4. Шаг 3 «Номер»: поиск по area code/городу/digits с фильтрами voice/sms (существующий GET search), покупка (существующий POST buy с лимитом номеров по плану), номер записывается в `phone_number_settings` компании с webhooks; визард показывает завершение; состояние приложения — Connected; пункт чеклиста Части A автоматически выполняется.
5. Компания с уже подключённой телефонией (есть `company_telephony`, включая Boston Masters): плитка отображается как Connected (состояние **выводится из фактического подключения**, по паттерну «connected-state derived from the real mailbox» из SEND-DOC-001 D.3 — без обязательного ретроактивного install), кнопка Manage ведёт в существующий Settings → Telephony; повторный визард не навязывается. Для НЕподключённой компании прямой заход в Settings → Telephony отправляет подключаться в Marketplace-визард (connect-флоу не дублируется в двух местах).

### Часть C — Фиксы изоляции Twilio (аудит проведён; чинить ВСЕ 5)

**Описание:** Закрыть все пять вердиктов аудита изоляции: (1) входящий звонок на неизвестный/бесхозный номер → TwiML Reject + структурный лог (сейчас — generic voicemail без company-контекста, `backend/src/webhooks/twilioWebhooks.js:345-360`); (2) `phone_number_settings.company_id` → NOT NULL + backfill (mig 091 допускает orphan); (3) UNIQUE на `phone_number_settings.phone_number` и `company_telephony.twilio_subaccount_sid`; (4) wallet-гейт ДО роутинга звонка (сейчас обходится при null company); (5) softphone token fail-closed для не-дефолтных компаний (сейчас тихий фолбэк на master env creds, `backend/src/services/voiceService.js:61-77`).

**Пользовательские сценарии (негативные/проверочные):**
1. Входящий звонок на номер, не принадлежащий ни одной компании (company не определяется ни по `AccountSid`, ни по `To` — `companyIdForNumber`, `twilioWebhooks.js:9-16`): звонок отклоняется (Reject), в лог пишется структурная запись с CallSid/AccountSid/To и причиной; generic voicemail без company-контекста больше не исполняется.
2. После миграции все существующие строки `phone_number_settings` с NULL `company_id` забэкфиллены (по субаккаунту/seed-правилу), колонка NOT NULL; создать «бесхозный» номер невозможно.
3. Попытка вставить второй ряд с тем же `phone_number` (или второй `company_telephony` с тем же `twilio_subaccount_sid`) отклоняется на уровне БД; миграция предварительно выявляет и разрешает существующие дубликаты (иначе UNIQUE не встанет).
4. Входящий звонок компании с заблокированным кошельком (баланс на/ниже floor) отклоняется **до** исполнения call flow; сценарий «company=null → гейт обойдён» невозможен (такой звонок отклонён фиксом 1 ещё раньше).
5. Запрос softphone-токена компанией без собственных субаккаунт-кредов (любая, кроме дефолтной seed-компании) получает явную ошибку (fail-closed), а не тихий токен на master env creds; Boston Masters продолжает работать на master env как раньше.

### Ограничения и нефункциональные требования

**Безопасность (обязательные правила проекта, повторены):**
- Все новые/изменяемые API: `authenticate` + `requireCompanyAccess`; `company_id` берётся ТОЛЬКО из `req.companyFilter?.company_id` (никогда из payload клиента).
- Каждый SQL фильтрует по `company_id`; чужой id → 404.
- Обязательные тесты: 401/403 на каждый новый эндпоинт + тесты tenant-изоляции (кросс-tenant чтение/запись невозможны).
- Webhook-пути остаются на существующей модели ALB-107: компания по `AccountSid` (fallback `To`), подпись — токеном соответствующего субаккаунта.

**Часть A:**
- Чеклист — расширяемая data-модель пунктов (хранилище выберет архитектор: кандидаты — `companies.settings` JSONB (mig 010) или новая таблица/колонки); «выполнено» для пункта телефонии — вычисляемое условие «у компании ≥1 активный купленный номер», без ручной отметки.
- Карточка: full-width, в потоке (сдвигает контент), не оверлей; collapse-состояние персистентно; полное скрытие до выполнения невозможно; после выполнения всех пунктов не показывается никогда.
- Только `tenant_admin` (фронт + backend). Email-пункт — вне скоупа.
- Дизайн: канон CLAUDE.md (Blanc-токены `--blanc-*`, без `<hr>`, `.blanc-eyebrow`), user-facing имя продукта — Albusto.

**Часть B:**
- Новое приложение по канону marketplace: seed-миграция в `marketplace_apps`, install lifecycle и per-company state в `marketplace_installations` (+`metadata` JSONB), гейтинг через `findActiveInstallation`; core marketplace не переписывается.
- Новый план Pay-as-you-go выражается через существующую модель планов (`billing_plans` + included units mig 103 + per-plan limits/ставки mig 107/108): $0/мес, 0 включённых минут, ставки списания с кошелька $0.04/мин звонки и $0.03/SMS (дефолт владельца). Лимит номеров плана (`max_phone_numbers`) = **1** (решение владельца, интервью 2026-07-02: как trial; нужно больше номеров — апсел в пакетные планы). Аренда номеров отдельно не тарифицируется (как и в существующих планах).
- Активация Pay-as-you-go не требует принудительного пополнения кошелька на шаге визарда; действует существующий wallet-гейт (`walletService`) при исчерпании.
- Пакетные планы — строго существующий Stripe checkout / `billingService`; платформенный billing webhook не меняется.
- Идемпотентность: повторные проходы визарда не плодят субаккаунты/планы/installations.
- Существующие компании (в первую очередь Boston Masters) — нулевые изменения поведения; connected-состояние приложения выводится из фактического `company_telephony`.

**Часть C:**
- Все фиксы — fail-closed; Reject сопровождается структурным логом (CallSid, AccountSid, To, причина) для диагностики.
- Миграции идемпотентны; backfill логирует число затронутых строк (паттерн mig 140); перед UNIQUE — детект/разрешение дубликатов.
- Фиксы не должны изменить маршрутизацию легитимных звонков: существующий call flow (F017 `callFlowRuntime`), autonomous mode override (mig 142, чтение флага fail-open) и все текущие сценарии Boston Masters работают как прежде.
- Fail-closed для softphone — только для не-дефолтных компаний; дефолтная seed-компания остаётся на master env creds.

**Общие:**
- Backend — CommonJS; фронт собирается `npm run build` (tsc -b, prod-сборка строже).
- Нумерация новых миграций: фактический максимум в `backend/db/migrations` на 2026-07-02 — **144** (`144_rehome_orphan_open_tasks.sql`), новые начинаются со **145**; перепроверить максимум непосредственно перед созданием (параллельные ветки).
- Деплой в прод — только по явному подтверждению владельца.

### Потенциально вовлечённые модули/части системы (по architecture.md)

**Backend:**
- `backend/src/routes/onboarding.js` + `platformCompanyService.bootstrapCompany` (ALB-100 identity plane) — контекст создания компании/tenant_admin; менять минимально или не менять (чеклист derived).
- Новый/расширенный эндпоинт состояния онбординг-чеклиста (роутер определит архитектор; company-scoped, tenant_admin-only).
- `backend/src/db/marketplaceQueries.js` (`ensureMarketplaceSchema` += новая seed-миграция), `backend/src/services/marketplaceService.js`, `backend/src/routes/marketplace.js` — reuse install/disconnect/findActiveInstallation (канон F016/F018).
- `backend/src/routes/telephonyNumbers.js` (connect/search/buy/release, softphone/setup) — reuse; возможен статус-эндпоинт для визарда.
- `backend/src/services/telephonyTenantService.js` (`getClientForCompany`, `getSoftphoneCreds`/`ensureSoftphoneSetup`) и `backend/src/services/voiceService.js` — фикс C5.
- `backend/src/webhooks/twilioWebhooks.js` (`handleVoiceInbound`, `companyIdForNumber`) — фиксы C1 и C4.
- `backend/src/services/billingService.js` + `backend/src/routes/billing.js` — seed/применение плана Pay-as-you-go, применение выбора тарифа из визарда; `walletService` — reuse ставок/гейта.
- Миграции 145+: seed marketplace-приложения; seed billing-плана PAYG; NOT NULL + backfill `phone_number_settings.company_id`; UNIQUE ×2.

**Frontend:**
- Страница Pulse (`usePulsePage.ts` + layout-компонент страницы) — новая карточка `OnboardingChecklistCard` в потоке; `frontend/src/hooks/useAuthz.ts` (`isTenantAdmin`) — reuse.
- `frontend/src/pages/IntegrationsPage.tsx` + `frontend/src/services/marketplaceApi.ts` — плитка нового приложения.
- Новая страница-визард `/settings/integrations/telephony-twilio` (по образцу `VapiSettingsPage.tsx` / `StripePaymentsSettingsPage.tsx`) + API-клиент; роут в `frontend/src/App.tsx`.
- Существующие `/settings/telephony/*` (TelephonyLayout: RouteManagerOverview, PhoneNumbers, ProviderSettings, UserGroups) — остаются; для неподключённой компании — отсылка в Marketplace-визард вместо локального connect.

### Затронутые интеграции

- **Twilio** — Subaccounts (существующий connect), AvailablePhoneNumbers search / purchase, Voice inbound webhooks (Reject-фикс), Access Token softphone (fail-closed). Новых типов Twilio-вызовов нет — меняется гейтинг/поведение существующих.
- **Stripe** — только существующий checkout для пакетных планов (платформенный биллинг); новых Stripe-поверхностей нет; PAYG идёт через wallet.
- **Keycloak** — без изменений (роль `tenant_admin` уже есть).
- **Front / Zenbooker / Google** — не затронуты.

### Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать)

- `src/server.js` (только mount-only при явной необходимости), `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`, `frontend/src/hooks/useRealtimeEvents.ts`.
- `backend/db/` — существующие миграции не трогать; изменения только новыми миграциями 145+ по явному плану.
- **Boston Masters (seed 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001):** номера на master-аккаунте, softphone на env creds, маршрутизация звонков — поведение байт-в-байт как сейчас.
- Существующий контракт webhooks ALB-107 (определение компании по `AccountSid`→`To`, per-subaccount подпись) и исполнение call flow F017 (`callFlowRuntime`), включая TELEPHONY-AUTONOMOUS-MODE-001 (`autonomous_mode`, fail-open чтение).
- Платформенный биллинг: `billingService` контракты, `/api/billing/webhook` (raw-body mount), Stripe checkout/portal, BillingScheduler; wallet-леджер (mig 109); `walletService.assertServiceActive` остаётся единственной точкой сервис-гейта исходящих SMS (на неё завязаны SEND-DOC-001 и ONWAY-001).
- Marketplace core: `/api/marketplace/*` lifecycle, существующие 5 приложений и их страницы, `MarketplaceConnectDialog` (protected ещё с F016).
- Существующие страницы Settings → Telephony (номера/группы/флоу) — остаются рабочими для подключённых компаний.
- Идемпотентность и транзакция `platformCompanyService.bootstrapCompany`; `POST /api/onboarding` (authenticate-only — так задумано).

### Out of scope

- Email-пункт чеклиста и любые другие новые пункты (модель расширяемая, но сейчас ровно один пункт).
- Изменение существующих цен/лимитов планов trial/starter/pro/huge; proration/downgrade-флоу; авто-пополнение кошелька.
- Port-in номеров, международные номера, A2P-изменения (ALB-107 Phase 2/3 — как есть).
- Изменение call flow/групп/softphone-функциональности (F017) сверх фиксов изоляции C.
- Ретроактивная миграция существующих компаний на новые планы.

## EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001: outbound-first email threads surface in the Pulse unified list

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-07-03 · **Owner:** Pulse / Email
**Type:** behavior change, backend-only (one SQL surfacing change + tests; NO new UI — icons already shipped in EMAIL-UNREAD-001, commit d455c52). Owner decisions D1–D4 fixed by interview, binding.

### Duplication check (result)

Not a duplicate — this closes a visibility gap between three shipped features:

- **EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 / EMAIL-UNREAD-001** already ingest and link outbound email (CRM composer `sendForContact`, email-workspace composer, and Gmail-direct sends recipient-matched by `linkOutboundMessage`): `email_messages.contact_id / timeline_id / on_timeline=true` (mig 129) are written, the contact's **timeline detail** shows the outbound bubble, and the list icons `email_inbound`/`email_outbound` (Mail / MailCheck) are live in `PulseContactItem`.
- **LIST-PAGINATION-001** built the unified list query (`getUnifiedTimelinePage`), whose `email_by_contact` CTE resolves contact→email-thread **only via INBOUND messages** (`JOIN contact_emails ON email_normalized = lower(trim(em.from_email)) … AND em.direction='inbound'`).
- Net effect (the bug): a thread the dispatcher **initiated** that has no reply yet is fully linked in the data and visible in the timeline detail, but the contact's row **never appears in the unified list**. Only the list CTE is blind; nothing else needs building.

### Description

When a dispatcher writes the FIRST email to a contact (email-only leads/clients are common) and there is no reply yet, the contact must still appear in the Pulse unified by-contact list: ordered by the thread's last message time like any other channel event, showing the outbound-email icon (MailCheck), and NOT marked unread (the dispatcher wrote it). Fix = make the `email_by_contact` resolution direction-agnostic so a contact's latest email thread is found whether its messages are inbound-matched or outbound-linked. The list's surfacing predicate already includes `eml.email_thread_id IS NOT NULL`, so a correct CTE automatically surfaces the row — no route/response-shape change.

### User scenarios

1. **Email-only lead outreach (CRM composer).** A lead has an email address but no phone activity. The dispatcher opens the contact and sends the first email from the Pulse composer (or the email workspace). On the next list fetch the contact appears in the unified list, positioned by the email's time, with the MailCheck (outbound) icon, and is NOT unread and NOT in the Action-Required band.
2. **Dispatcher writes from Gmail directly.** The dispatcher sends the first email to a known contact from the shared Gmail mailbox itself (no CRM involved). The send is push-ingested and recipient-matched (`linkOutboundMessage`), and the contact surfaces in the unified list exactly as in scenario 1 — no CRM action required. A saved/edited Gmail DRAFT never surfaces anything (existing guard).
3. **Reply arrives → inbound-latest.** The contact later replies. The same row re-orders by the reply time, flips to the Mail (inbound) icon, and becomes unread (thread `unread_count` > 0 → unread tier), exactly like an inbound-first thread; Pulse mark-read clears it (EMAIL-UNREAD-001 route).
4. **Mixed-channel contact.** A contact with existing calls/SMS receives a first-touch outbound email that is now their latest interaction: their existing row re-orders by the email time (`last_interaction_at` = greatest of call/SMS/email) and shows the outbound-email icon. No duplicate row appears.
5. **Two threads, one row.** A contact has an older inbound-matched thread and a newer dispatcher-initiated thread: the list shows ONE row for the contact reflecting the most recent thread (by `last_message_at` across BOTH directions). An outbound email whose recipients match no contact surfaces nothing (stays workspace-only; no contact auto-create).

### Functional requirements

- **FR-1.** `email_by_contact` in `getUnifiedTimelinePage` (`backend/src/db/timelinesQueries.js`) resolves a contact's single most-recent email thread across **both** inbound-matched and outbound-linked messages, keeping the DISTINCT-one-thread-per-contact semantics and the exposed columns (`email_thread_id`, `email_subject`, `last_message_at`, `last_message_direction`, `unread_count`) unchanged in shape.
- **FR-2.** An outbound-only thread surfaces its contact's row via the existing predicate (`eml.email_thread_id IS NOT NULL`), ordered by the standard `GREATEST(call, SMS, email)` recency, in the normal (non-AR, non-unread) tier.
- **FR-3.** Unread semantics unchanged: outbound-first rows have `any_unread = false` (thread `unread_count` grows only on inbound; `linkOutboundMessage` even clears it on outbound). Must be asserted by test, not assumed.
- **FR-4.** All three send paths surface: Pulse composer (`emailTimelineService.sendForContact`), email-workspace composer, Gmail-direct (push → `linkOutboundMessage`). No changes to those services — they already link; the list just reads.
- **FR-5.** **Historical parity:** outbound-first threads sent BEFORE this fix must surface too (D1 parity with inbound, which text-matches all history). If the CTE reads the persisted link (mig 129 columns) rather than re-matching recipient text, an idempotent backfill migration must link historical outbound messages (recipient-match per `linkOutboundMessage` rules, company-scoped, logged row-count — mig 140/144/154 pattern).
- **FR-6.** Subject search keeps working and now also matches outbound-first threads (search predicate already reads `eml.email_subject` — alias must not change, see LIST-PAGINATION-001 search fix d56db8f).

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** Contact with zero calls/SMS/inbound email + one outbound email → appears in the unified list with `email_last_message_direction='outbound'` (→ MailCheck icon), correct recency position, `any_unread=false`, not pinned to AR.
- **AC-2.** Same outcome when the first email is sent from Gmail directly (ingested via push); DRAFT-labeled messages never surface a row.
- **AC-3.** After an inbound reply, the row shows inbound direction + unread, and re-orders by the reply time; Pulse mark-read clears it. Existing inbound-first behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged (regression suite).
- **AC-4.** One row per contact with multiple threads (newest thread wins across directions); page size, `total_count`, offset pagination, AR band pinning, and orphan-shadow dedup invariants all hold.
- **AC-5.** Tenancy: an outbound-first thread surfaces ONLY in the sending company's list; every new/changed predicate carries `company_id = $1` scoping (both `email_messages` and `email_threads`, as today).
- **AC-6.** Performance: `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` of the real `getUnifiedTimelinePage` against a prod-sized DB copy shows no plan regression — no per-row Seq Scan over `email_messages`, page latency comparable to the current ~0.3s baseline (PULSE-PERF-001 discipline). Any new predicate is exactly index-backed (new migration if needed).

### Constraints / non-functional

- **PERFORMANCE IS CRITICAL — this is THE hot Pulse query** (PULSE-PERF-001 history: 8.4s→0.3s). Mandatory methodology: time the real function in the app container + `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on a prod copy BEFORE deploy; index expression must be an exact copy of the predicate. Existing supports: mig 143 functional index `email_messages (company_id, (lower(trim(from_email))))` (inbound leg — keep using it) and mig 129 partial index `email_messages (company_id, contact_id, gmail_internal_at) WHERE contact_id IS NOT NULL` (outbound-linked leg candidate).
- **Recipient text-matching in the hot query is effectively ruled out by data shape:** outbound recipients live in `email_messages.to_recipients_json` (JSONB array, mig 079) — per-row JSON expansion in the list query is not acceptable. The performant source for the outbound leg is the persisted link (mig 129 `contact_id`/`on_timeline`); the Architect picks the exact predicate, but AC-6 gates it.
- **Mocked jest is not enough** (LIST-PAGINATION-001 lesson: mocks validate the SQL string only) — run the REAL query against a prod-DB copy before deploy; cover: outbound-only thread, inbound+outbound mix, two-threads-newest-wins, no-match, draft, cross-tenant.
- `company_id` scoping is mandatory on every leg of the CTE (security rule; the SMS cross-tenant leak closed in LIST-PAGINATION-001 is the cautionary precedent).
- Response shape of `getUnifiedTimelinePage` rows must not change (frontend `PulseContactItem` mapping of `email_last_message_direction` → Mail/MailCheck shipped in d455c52 keys off existing fields).
- Unread rules must not change: `unread_count` increments only on inbound; no code path may mark unread on send. D2 is a verification requirement, not a change.
- Pagination invariants (LIST-PAGINATION-001): dedup/surfacing decided in SQL BEFORE `LIMIT`; a page is never shrunk post-query; `total_count` window count stays consistent.
- New migrations start at **155** (current max = 154 `154_backfill_contact_emails.sql`); re-verify the max immediately before creating (parallel branches). Any backfill: idempotent + logs affected row count + rollback file. Backend is CommonJS.
- Deploy to prod only with explicit owner consent (standing rule).

### Involved modules

- **Backend:** `backend/src/db/timelinesQueries.js` — `getUnifiedTimelinePage`, the `email_by_contact` CTE (the ONLY behavioral change point). Optional migration 155+ (index for the outbound leg and/or historical-link backfill) strictly as EXPLAIN/FR-5 dictate.
- **Tests:** backend jest for the query builder + tenancy/unread assertions; real-query verification vs prod-copy (documented in the PR).
- **Frontend:** none (icons + unread rendering already shipped; behavior verified, not modified).

### Integrations

- **Google / Gmail** — no API-surface change (ingest, push, linking all exist). **Twilio / Front / Zenbooker / Stripe** — untouched.

### Protected parts (must not break)

- `emailTimelineService` semantics: `linkOutboundMessage` (recipient match, DRAFT guard, idempotent re-link, SSE-only/no-unread), `sendForContact`, `markThreadRead`-on-outbound (EMAIL-UNREAD-001).
- The contact **timeline detail** projection (`GET /api/pulse/timeline/:contactId`, `buildTimeline`) — already correct for outbound email; zero changes.
- EMAIL-001 standalone `/email` workspace: inbox, threads, composer, sync/scheduler, Pub/Sub push pipeline.
- Unified-list invariants in `getUnifiedTimelinePage`: AR band pinning (open_task tier), unread tier, `GREATEST` ordering, orphan-shadow dedup (SQL before LIMIT), search predicate incl. the `eml.email_subject` alias, SMS lateral company scoping, `total_count` envelope.
- Existing migrations (079, 129, 130, 143, 154) and the mig 143 index; `src/server.js`, `authedFetch.ts`, `useRealtimeEvents.ts`.
- Unread model: inbound-only unread growth; Pulse mark-read route behavior (timeline+contact+SMS+email clearing) from EMAIL-UNREAD-001.

### Out of scope

- Any new UI (icons/labels shipped in d455c52); email workspace changes; contact auto-creation from unknown recipients; CC/BCC matching changes; unread-model changes; surfacing outbound email on **orphan** (contactless) timelines — outbound links are contact-rooted by definition.

## TASKS-COUNT-BADGE-001: "open tasks" counter badge in navigation

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P2 · **Date:** 2026-07-03 · **Owner:** Tasks / Frontend nav
**Type:** feature · backend (count route) + frontend (nav badge, hybrid SSE+poll). Direct clone of LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001, applied to Tasks. Owner decision (interview) binding: the badge counts **ALL OPEN tasks VISIBLE TO THE CURRENT USER** — exactly the set the user sees on `/tasks` with the "Only Open" filter. Not overdue-only, not today-only — the full open backlog visible to that user.

### Duplication check (result)

Not a duplicate. **LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001** is the pattern to mirror (a status-derived nav badge), but it counts *leads* by lead status and is company-wide. This feature counts *tasks* and is **RBAC-scoped per user** (managers see all company open tasks; everyone else sees only their own), so it needs its own count route reusing the Tasks visibility model, not the leads one. The Tasks section itself (**AR-TASK-UNIFY-001 / TASKS-001**) has no nav badge today — the `tasks` nav item (`appLayoutNavigation.tsx` line ~18, `ListChecks` icon, perm `tasks.view`) renders bare.

### Description

A count badge (number in a circle — the same `pulse-unread-badge` used by the Pulse and Leads badges) on the **Tasks** nav item = the number of **open tasks visible to the current user**, i.e. the exact row count `GET /api/tasks?status=open` returns for that user. Visibility follows the Tasks model verbatim: a user with `tasks.manage` sees every open company task; every other role sees only tasks they own (`owner_user_id = their crm_users.id`). Not read/unread — it is derived from live task state and persists until tasks are completed (or reassigned away from the user). Company-scoped. Hybrid freshness like the Leads badge: refetch on mount + on route change + a 60s poll fallback, plus (if the Architect adds task realtime events) an SSE-triggered refetch filtered by `company_id`.

### User scenarios

1. **Manager sees the full company backlog.** A user with `tasks.manage` (tenant_admin / manager) has the Tasks badge showing the count of ALL open tasks in the company — identical to the number of rows in their `/tasks` "Only Open" view.
2. **Provider / dispatcher sees only their own.** A non-manager (provider, dispatcher) sees the count of only the open tasks assigned to them (`owner_user_id` = their `crm_users.id`). Another user's open tasks never contribute to their badge.
3. **Create → increments.** A new open task is created (any path — timeline "Action Required", `/tasks` composer, in-card stack) and, for every user to whom it is visible, the Tasks badge increments to reflect it.
4. **Complete → decrements.** A task is marked done → the badge decrements for everyone who could see it.
5. **Reopen → increments.** A previously-completed task is reopened (status back to `open`) → the badge increments again for its visible audience.
6. **Reassign → moves between users.** A task's owner is changed → it leaves the old owner's badge and (unless the recipient is a manager who already counted it company-wide) enters the new owner's badge. Manager badges are unaffected by reassignment (still one open company task).
7. **Zero is silent.** When a user has no visible open tasks, the badge is not rendered at all (no "0" circle).
8. **9+ cap.** A visible open count above 9 renders as `9+` (desktop and mobile), matching the Pulse/Leads badges exactly.
9. **Opening Tasks does not clear it.** Navigating to `/tasks` does not zero or dismiss the badge — it is state-derived, not a read-marker; it only changes when the underlying open tasks change.

### Functional requirements

- **FR-1.** New backend count endpoint (e.g. `GET /api/tasks/count` or `/open-count`) gated by `requirePermission('tasks.view')`, returning the LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001 response shape `{ ok: true, data: { count } }` (matching the existing Tasks routes' `{ ok, data }` envelope and the leads badge contract).
- **FR-2.** The count MUST be produced by the **same visibility logic as `GET /api/tasks`** with `status='open'`: reuse `tasksQueries` so the predicate is `t.company_id = $companyId` **AND `HAS_ENTITY_PARENT`** (the exact `tasksQueries.js` expression: has a `job_id/lead_id/estimate_id/invoice_id/contact_id`, OR a `thread_id` with `created_by IN ('user','agent')`) **AND `t.status='open'`** AND — for non-managers — `t.owner_user_id = actorId(req)`; managers (`canManage` / `tasks.manage`) omit the owner scope. Prefer a `COUNT(*)` variant of `listTasks` (or `listTasks(...).length`) so the two can never diverge. `actorId(req)` = `req.user.crmUser.id`, `companyId(req)` = `req.companyFilter.company_id` — as in `routes/tasks.js`.
- **FR-3.** Frontend: thread an `openTasksCount` (naming parallel to `leadsNewCount`) through `AppLayout.tsx` → `appLayoutNavigation.tsx`; render the badge on the `tasks` nav item in **both** `AppNavTabs` (desktop) and `BottomNavBar` (mobile) using the existing `pulse-unread-badge` span with the `count > 9 ? '9+' : count` rule and a `title` like `"{n} open tasks"`; render nothing when `count === 0`.
- **FR-4.** Freshness = the Leads badge recipe: fetch on mount, on route change, and on a 60s interval poll fallback. **Realtime is an OPEN DESIGN CHOICE for the Architect, NOT decided here:** Tasks currently emit **no** SSE events (the event catalog has only `agent_task.succeeded/failed`), so either (a) introduce minimal PII-free `task.*` events (`created` / `updated` / `completed`, carrying at most `company_id` + `owner_user_id` + `id`/`status`) and wire them additively into `useRealtimeEvents.ts` `genericEventTypes` AND `sseManager.ts` `namedEvents` (both lists, per LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001), refetching filtered by `company_id`; **or** (b) ship poll-only for v1 and defer events. The Architect decides; this requirement only mandates that whichever path is chosen, the badge is eventually consistent within the 60s poll window.

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** For a `tasks.manage` user, the badge value **equals** the number of rows `GET /api/tasks?status=open` returns for that user (whole-company open set). Verified by comparing the count endpoint's result to the list length for the same session.
- **AC-2.** For a non-manager, the badge value equals `GET /api/tasks?status=open` for that user (own open set only), and a task owned by a different user never changes it.
- **AC-3.** The badge count **never exceeds** what `/tasks` lists for the same user (the count and the list share one predicate — including `HAS_ENTITY_PARENT`, so agent-generated/shadow timeline tasks that `/tasks` hides are excluded from the count too).
- **AC-4.** Create → badge +1; complete → badge −1; reopen → badge +1; reassign → moves between the correct owners; all reflected within the 60s poll window (immediately if SSE is chosen).
- **AC-5.** Badge is absent at count 0; renders `9+` above 9; identical markup/behavior on desktop (`AppNavTabs`) and mobile (`BottomNavBar`).
- **AC-6.** Tenancy: the count is scoped by `company_id = $1`; a user in company A never sees tasks from company B contribute to the badge (same guarantee the Tasks routes already enforce).

### Constraints / non-functional

- **The count predicate MUST equal the `/api/tasks` open-list predicate exactly** — same `tasksQueries` source, same `HAS_ENTITY_PARENT` filter, same manager-vs-owner scoping, same `status='open'`. This is the load-bearing invariant (AC-1..AC-3); implement the count as a `COUNT`/length over the existing `listTasks` filter set, never a hand-rewritten WHERE, so drift is structurally impossible.
- **Route order:** if the endpoint is a bare segment under `/api/tasks` (e.g. `/count`, `/open-count`), it MUST be mounted **above** any `/:id` route in `routes/tasks.js` (mirror of the `/new-count`-before-`/:uuid` caveat in `leads.js:162`), or Express matches the literal as an `:id`.
- **Permission:** `tasks.view` only (same gate as the list). No new permission, no migration — this is a read over existing task rows.
- **SSE payload (if events are added) must be PII-free** — at most `company_id`, `owner_user_id`, `id`, `status`; the client filters by `company_id` (LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001 discipline). Any new event name goes in **both** `useRealtimeEvents.ts` and `sseManager.ts` (a name in only one is silently dead).
- **`useRealtimeEvents.ts` may be touched only additively** (append event type(s) to the generic channel), per the LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001 precedent — no restructuring of the realtime layer.
- Count query must stay cheap (indexed `company_id` + `status` + `owner_user_id`); it runs on every mount/route-change/poll and, if events are added, on each task event — do not introduce a per-row scan.
- Deploy to prod only with explicit owner consent (standing rule).

### Involved modules

- **Backend:** `backend/src/routes/tasks.js` (new count route, above `/:id`), `backend/src/db/tasksQueries.js` (add a count/length helper over the `listTasks` filter set — or reuse `listTasks` and take `.length`), and — only if realtime is chosen — the task event emit path + `eventCatalog` (currently `agent_task.succeeded/failed` only), `realtimeService`/`sseManager.ts`.
- **Frontend:** `AppLayout.tsx` (state `openTasksCount` + `fetchOpenTasksCount` + mount/route-change/60s-poll, mirroring `fetchLeadsNewCount`), `appLayoutNavigation.tsx` (`AppNavTabs` + `BottomNavBar` badge on the `tasks` item), `useRealtimeEvents.ts` + `sseManager.ts` (additive, only if events chosen), `AppLayout.css` (reuses existing `pulse-unread-badge`; no new class expected).

### Integrations

- None. **Twilio / Front / Zenbooker / Google / Stripe** — untouched. This is an internal read over the tasks table plus a nav-badge render.

### Protected parts (must not break)

- **`GET /api/tasks` list behavior and its visibility model** (`routes/tasks.js:41-64`, `tasksQueries.listTasks`, `HAS_ENTITY_PARENT`, `canManage`/`scopeOwnerId`) — the count reuses it and must not alter it; the AR-TASK-UNIFY-001 "open task = Action Required" timeline coupling stays intact.
- **RBAC gates** `tasks.view` / `tasks.manage` and `actorId = req.user.crmUser.id` semantics (created_by-FK-crm-user-id rule) — the count must resolve identity the same way, no fallback to `sub`.
- **LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001 wiring** (`leadsNewCount`, `/new-count` route, its SSE event types) — the Tasks badge is added **alongside**, threading a separate `openTasksCount`; the Leads/Pulse badges and their `pulse-unread-badge` markup must keep working unchanged.
- **`useRealtimeEvents.ts` / `sseManager.ts`** touched additively only; the existing Pulse/Leads realtime channels must not regress.

### Out of scope

- Any change to the Tasks visibility rules, the `/tasks` page, task filters, or the `HAS_ENTITY_PARENT` definition.
- Overdue-only / due-today-only counting, per-parent-type breakdowns, or a badge on any surface other than the `tasks` nav item.
- New task realtime events are **optional** (Architect's call under FR-4) — if deferred, poll-only is acceptable for v1; introducing them is not required by this requirement.
- Read/unread or "seen" state for tasks (the badge is state-derived, never dismissed by viewing).

## CONTACT-EMAIL-MERGE-001: adding an email to a contact merges that address's existing correspondence (email analogue of the phone-merge)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-07-04 · **Owner:** Contacts / Pulse / Email
**Type:** feature — frontend (multi-email editor) + backend (PATCH route writes `contact_emails`; new email-merge service). The email counterpart of the shipped phone-merge (`mergeOrphanTimelines`). Owner decisions D1–D3 (interview) binding.

### Duplication check (result)

Not a duplicate — it closes a real gap. Three shipped features around it, none of which do this:

- **Phone side (the pattern to mirror):** editing a contact's `phone_e164`/`secondary_phone` fires `mergeOrphanTimelines(contactId, [phone, secondary_phone])` async from `PATCH /api/contacts/:id` (`backend/src/routes/contacts.js` ~line 232-240), which re-points orphan (contactless) timelines + their calls + open tasks onto the contact, adopting/merging/deleting orphan timelines. **There is no email equivalent.**
- **`contact_emails` model exists (mig 025):** `(contact_id, email, email_normalized, is_primary, UNIQUE(contact_id, email_normalized), ON DELETE CASCADE)`; `contactDedupeService.enrichEmail(contactId, emailNorm)` already writes it idempotently (sets primary if the contact has none, else additional; `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`); `emailQueries.findEmailContact` resolves an address to a contact via `contacts.email OR contact_emails.email_normalized`; `emailQueries.linkMessageToContact(providerMessageId, companyId, {contact_id, timeline_id, on_timeline})` idempotently projects an `email_messages` row onto a contact/timeline.
- **The list already reads `contact_emails` (EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001 / LIST-PAGINATION-001):** `getUnifiedTimelinePage`'s `email_by_contact` CTE resolves contact→email-thread via `contact_emails.email_normalized` (both inbound-matched and outbound-linked legs). So once an added address lands in `contact_emails` and its messages are linked, the contact's row surfaces automatically — no list change needed.
- **The bug this closes:** `PATCH /api/contacts/:id` currently updates only the `contacts.email` scalar column and **never writes `contact_emails`** (pre-existing gap — the allowed-fields loop at ~line 172 sets `email` on the row and stops). So even a primary email typed in the editor is invisible to every `contact_emails`-keyed join, and no correspondence is ever merged. This feature must (a) persist emails to `contact_emails`, (b) support a multi-email list, and (c) merge each added address's existing correspondence.

### Description

The contact editor gains a **multi-email list** (one primary + any number of additional emails) — the exact analogue of the secondary-phone model — persisted to `contact_emails`. When an email is added to a contact (via the new editor, on create, or via any path that adds a `contact_emails` row) and that address **already has email correspondence in the same company**, that correspondence merges into THIS contact's timeline so it becomes part of the conversation and surfaces in the Pulse unified list. "Already has correspondence" resolves into three cases (owner D1–D3):

- **Inbox-only (no contact at all):** `email_messages` for that address with `contact_id IS NULL` / not on any timeline → **link** them onto this contact's timeline (they surface + join the conversation). [D3]
- **Owned by an EMAIL-ONLY auto-contact** (a contact that exists ONLY because an inbound email auto-created it — no phone, no business entities): **FULL MERGE** — re-point that contact's emails / tasks / timeline / everything onto THIS contact, then DELETE the now-empty contact. [D2a]
- **Owned by a contact WITH its own identity/data** (has a phone OR any business entity — job/lead/estimate/invoice/payment): **do NOT delete it** — re-point ONLY the `email_messages` (and their thread linkage) for the added address onto this contact's timeline; the other contact stays intact and keeps its own identity. [D2b]

If the added address has **no** correspondence anywhere, it is simply recorded in `contact_emails` (nothing to merge). Multiple emails may be added at once or over time; each is resolved independently. The merge runs on the same seam as the phone-merge (async from the PATCH route by default) and is idempotent.

### User scenarios

1. **Add an email that has inbox-only correspondence → linked.** A contact has a phone but the dispatcher knows their email; that address has two inbound emails sitting in the shared inbox with no contact attached (`contact_id NULL`). The dispatcher adds the email in the contact editor and Saves. The two messages are linked onto this contact's timeline (`emailQueries.linkMessageToContact`, `on_timeline=true`), the thread is attached, and the contact's row now reflects that email thread in the Pulse unified list (via the existing `email_by_contact` CTE). The email history is visible in the contact's timeline detail.
2. **Add an email owned by an email-only auto-contact → full merge + delete.** Address `x@acme.com` earlier arrived as an inbound email that auto-created a bare contact (no name/phone, no jobs/leads/estimates/invoices/payments — it exists solely to hold that email thread). The dispatcher adds `x@acme.com` to a real contact "Jane Smith". On Save: that auto-contact's email messages, email thread, its timeline, and any open tasks are re-pointed onto Jane's timeline; the emptied auto-contact is deleted. Jane's list row and timeline now own the whole thread; the duplicate contact is gone.
3. **Add an email owned by a contact WITH a phone/job → re-point emails only, keep the contact.** Address `bob@acme.com` belongs to contact "Bob" who also has a phone number and an open job. The dispatcher adds `bob@acme.com` to a different contact "Acme Billing". On Save: only the `email_messages` for `bob@acme.com` (and their thread link) are re-pointed onto Acme Billing's timeline; **Bob is NOT deleted** and keeps his phone, job, calls, and his own timeline. (Owner-accepted consequence: that email correspondence now lives under Acme Billing; Bob's non-email history is untouched.)
4. **Add an email with no correspondence anywhere → just recorded.** The dispatcher adds a brand-new email that has never appeared in any message. It is written to `contact_emails` (primary if the contact had none, else additional). No merge, no timeline change, no list change beyond the address now being on file (and future inbound/outbound for it will resolve to this contact).
5. **Multiple emails on one contact.** A contact legitimately has several addresses (personal + work). The editor lists the primary and all additional emails, allows adding several, and marks exactly one primary. Each added address independently runs its own resolution (link / full-merge / re-point / record). Re-saving with the same set is a no-op (idempotent; `UNIQUE(contact_id, email_normalized)` + `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).
6. **Editing the primary email persists to `contact_emails` (closes the pre-existing gap).** Simply changing the primary email in the editor (the case that does nothing today) now writes/updates the `contact_emails` primary row so the address is visible to all `contact_emails`-keyed joins, and triggers the same merge resolution for the new address.
7. **Removing an email (scope decision — see FR-8 / constraints).** Deleting an address from the list removes the `contact_emails` row. Whether removal also **un-links** the previously-merged messages (reverse the merge) or **only stops future resolution** (leaves already-merged history in place) is a product/architect decision flagged below — the safe default is: remove the `contact_emails` row and leave already-linked history on the timeline (no destructive un-merge), and this scenario is a candidate to defer entirely if it complicates v1.

### Functional requirements

- **FR-1.** The contact editor renders a **multi-email list**: one primary email + zero-or-more additional emails, add/remove rows, exactly one primary. Follows FORM-CANON (floating-label filled fields, right-side panel) and mirrors the secondary-phone UX. Emails are validated (basic email shape) before Save.
- **FR-2.** `PATCH /api/contacts/:id` (and the create path) **persists the full email set to `contact_emails`**, not just the `contacts.email` scalar: upsert each address (`email`, `email_normalized = lower(trim(email))`, `is_primary`) with `ON CONFLICT (contact_id, email_normalized) DO NOTHING`, keep the scalar `contacts.email` in sync with the primary (existing consumers still read it), and enforce a single `is_primary=true` row. Reuse `contactDedupeService.enrichEmail` semantics rather than hand-rolling the insert. The request contract for emails (shape of the emails payload) is an architect detail; the route must accept and durably store the list.
- **FR-3.** After persisting, for **each newly-added** address the backend runs an **email-merge resolution** (new service, the email analogue of `timelineMergeService.mergeOrphanTimelines`) scoped to the contact's `company_id`:
  - resolve the address to an owning contact via `email_normalized` (like `findEmailContact`) within the same company;
  - **no owner (inbox-only):** link every `email_messages` row for that address (and its thread) onto this contact's timeline via `linkMessageToContact` (`on_timeline=true`), creating/adopting the contact's timeline with `timelinesQueries.findOrCreateTimelineByContact` (which already re-homes shadow-orphan open tasks); [D3]
  - **owner is EMAIL-ONLY (empty):** FULL MERGE — re-point that contact's `email_messages` / email threads / tasks / timeline (+ `contact_emails`, addresses M2M with NOT-EXISTS guards) onto this contact respecting FK order (tasks → timelines → contact), then DELETE the emptied contact; [D2a]
  - **owner HAS identity/data:** re-point ONLY the `email_messages` (+ thread link) for that address onto this contact's timeline; leave the other contact and all its non-email data intact (no delete). [D2b]
- **FR-4.** **"Email-only / empty" predicate (the D2a↔D2b decision gate)** = the owning contact has NO `phone_e164` AND NO `secondary_phone` AND no referencing rows in the business-entity tables (`jobs`, `leads`, `estimates`, `invoices`, `payments`) AND no independent tasks — i.e. it exists only to hold email(s). The **exact** table list and predicate are an **architect decision** (must enumerate every table with a `contact_id` FK so nothing that constitutes "identity/data" is missed); FR-4 fixes the intent (delete only when the contact is truly nothing-but-email), the architect fixes the SQL.
- **FR-5.** The merge is **idempotent**: re-running for the same address/contact produces no duplicate links, no double-move, and no error; `linkMessageToContact` is a no-op re-link, `contact_emails` upserts `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, and a full-merge whose source is already gone is a clean no-op.
- **FR-6.** The merge is **company-scoped**: it only ever resolves/moves messages, threads, contacts, and timelines within the editing contact's `company_id`. No cross-tenant resolution or deletion is possible (address collisions across companies are independent).
- **FR-7.** Once `contact_emails` holds the address and messages are linked, the **Pulse unified list surfaces the contact's email thread with no list-code change** (the `email_by_contact` CTE already resolves via `contact_emails.email_normalized`, both directions — EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001). Timeline detail shows the merged email history.
- **FR-8.** **Email removal (scope-flagged).** Removing an address deletes its `contact_emails` row. Whether removal also reverses a prior merge (un-links messages) is DEFERRED unless the architect/owner rules otherwise; default v1 behavior = remove the row, keep already-linked history in place (non-destructive). This FR exists to force an explicit decision, not to mandate un-merge.

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** Adding an email whose only footprint is inbox-only messages links those messages onto the contact's timeline (`on_timeline=true`, contact's timeline id, thread attached); the contact then appears in the unified list positioned by the thread's last-message time with the correct email icon, and the thread shows in timeline detail. Re-saving is a no-op.
- **AC-2.** Adding an email owned by an email-only auto-contact re-homes all of its email messages/threads/tasks/timeline onto the target contact and DELETES the auto-contact (`findEmailContact` for that address afterwards returns the target contact; the old contact id no longer exists; no orphaned `email_messages` / `contact_emails` / open tasks remain).
- **AC-3.** Adding an email owned by a contact that has a phone or any business entity re-points ONLY that address's email messages onto the target's timeline and **leaves the other contact intact** (its phone, calls, jobs/leads/estimates/invoices/payments, and its own timeline all still present; it is NOT deleted).
- **AC-4.** Adding an email with no correspondence writes exactly one `contact_emails` row (primary if the contact had none, else additional), performs no timeline/list change, and subsequent inbound/outbound for that address resolves to this contact.
- **AC-5.** Editing ONLY the primary email (no other change) now writes/updates the `contact_emails` primary row (regression against the current gap) and runs resolution for the new address; the scalar `contacts.email` stays in sync.
- **AC-6.** Tenancy: an address that also exists in another company is never touched; no message, thread, contact, or timeline outside the editing contact's `company_id` is read, moved, or deleted. Verified against a two-company fixture.
- **AC-7.** Idempotency / integrity: running the merge twice yields identical state; FK order is respected (no CASCADE destroys an open task — ORPHAN-TASK-REHOME-001 discipline); a full-merge deletes the source contact only after all its data is re-pointed.
- **AC-8.** The real query/merge is verified against a **prod-sized DB copy**, not just mocked jest (LIST-PAGINATION-001 lesson): cover inbox-only, empty-auto-contact full merge, has-identity re-point, no-correspondence, multi-email, cross-tenant isolation.

### Constraints / non-functional

- **Must write `contact_emails`.** The load-bearing fix: emails added via the new UI (including the primary) MUST land in `contact_emails` (`email_normalized = lower(trim(email))`), or the `email_by_contact` CTE and `findEmailContact` never see them and nothing merges or surfaces. Keep the scalar `contacts.email` in sync with the primary for existing consumers.
- **Async vs synchronous merge — ARCHITECT DECISION (flagged).** The phone-merge runs **async, non-blocking** after the PATCH responds (fire-and-forget with a caught, logged error). Mirroring that keeps Save latency low and is the default. BUT a delete-and-re-point merge has stronger consistency needs than the phone-merge's re-point-only; the architect must decide async (like phones) vs synchronous-in-request (or a transaction) — weighing Save latency vs the window where the UI shows a just-added email whose merge hasn't completed. Whichever is chosen: idempotent, and a failure must not corrupt state or lose the `contact_emails` write.
- **Idempotent** end to end (re-save, push redelivery, double-fire): `linkMessageToContact` no-op re-link, `contact_emails` `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, full-merge no-op when the source is already merged/gone.
- **Company scoping is mandatory on every leg** — resolution, message re-point, thread re-point, contact delete — all filtered by the editing contact's `company_id`. **No cross-tenant merge or delete.** (The SMS cross-tenant leak closed in LIST-PAGINATION-001 and the ZB-ISO-001 leak are the cautionary precedents.)
- **Deletion only when truly empty (D2).** A contact is deleted ONLY when it is email-only per the FR-4 predicate; any phone or business entity makes it re-point-only. The emptiness predicate must enumerate every `contact_id`-referencing table (architect) so "identity/data" is never under-counted and a real contact is never destroyed.
- **FK order / no silent task loss.** Re-point open tasks off a to-be-deleted timeline/contact BEFORE deleting (tasks.thread_id is `ON DELETE CASCADE` — the exact trap fixed in ORPHAN-TASK-REHOME-001); order = tasks → timelines → contact; M2M rows (`contact_emails`, addresses) moved with NOT-EXISTS guards to avoid unique-constraint collisions.
- **No general contact-merge service exists** — the full-merge path must be built (the owner's prior dedup was ad-hoc SQL). Build it as a reusable, tested service (email analogue of `timelineMergeService`), not inline route SQL.
- **Reuse existing primitives**, don't re-implement: `contactDedupeService.enrichEmail` (write `contact_emails`), `emailQueries.findEmailContact` (resolve owner), `emailQueries.linkMessageToContact` (project message onto contact/timeline), `timelinesQueries.findOrCreateTimelineByContact` (+ its `reassignShadowOrphanOpenTasks`).
- **The list needs no change** — `email_by_contact` already resolves via `contact_emails.email_normalized` (EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001). Do not touch `getUnifiedTimelinePage` unless a new index is required; if so, follow PULSE-PERF-001 (EXPLAIN on prod copy, index expression = exact predicate copy).
- **Mocked jest is not enough** (LIST-PAGINATION-001) — run the REAL merge against a prod-DB copy before deploy.
- **Migrations (if any) start at 156** — current max is `155_backfill_outbound_email_links.sql` (EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001 already claimed 155); re-verify the max immediately before creating (parallel branches). Any backfill: idempotent + logs affected row count + rollback file. Backend is CommonJS. Note: this feature may need **no** new migration (mig 025 `contact_emails` + mig 079/129 `email_messages` columns suffice) — add one only for a required index or a one-time historical resolution backfill.
- **Email removal semantics (FR-8)** must be explicitly decided (default: non-destructive) before implementation; do not ship a silent destructive un-merge.
- Deploy to prod only with explicit owner consent (standing rule).

### Involved modules

- **Backend:** `backend/src/routes/contacts.js` — `PATCH /:id` (persist `contact_emails`; trigger email-merge) and the create path; a **new email-merge service** (`backend/src/services/` — analogue of `timelineMergeService.js`); `backend/src/services/contactDedupeService.js` (`enrichEmail`, `getAdditionalEmails` — reuse/extend); `backend/src/db/emailQueries.js` (`findEmailContact`, `linkMessageToContact`, and likely a new company-scoped "list messages for address" helper); `backend/src/db/timelinesQueries.js` (`findOrCreateTimelineByContact`, `reassignShadowOrphanOpenTasks`).
- **Frontend:** the contact editor panel (multi-email list UI, mirroring the secondary-phone control) + its contacts API client for the emails payload.
- **Tests:** backend jest for the merge service (all D1–D3 branches, idempotency, tenancy, FK/task-safety) + real-query verification vs a prod-DB copy (documented in the PR).

### Integrations

- **Google / Gmail** — reuses the existing ingest/link seam (`linkMessageToContact`); no Gmail API-surface change. **Twilio / Front / Zenbooker / Stripe** — untouched (contact-email edits do not push to ZB email; the existing ZB contact sync on PATCH is unchanged).

### Protected parts (must not break)

- **Phone-merge** (`timelineMergeService.mergeOrphanTimelines`, its async trigger in `PATCH /:id`, ORPHAN-TASK-REHOME-001 task re-home) — the email path is added ALONGSIDE it; the phone path must keep working byte-for-byte.
- **`email_by_contact` CTE / `getUnifiedTimelinePage`** (EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001, LIST-PAGINATION-001) — do not change its shape/semantics; it should surface merged threads automatically.
- **`emailQueries.linkMessageToContact`** idempotent-re-link + DRAFT/unread semantics (EMAIL-UNREAD-001), and `findEmailContact` resolution — reused unchanged.
- **`contact_emails` invariants** (mig 025): `UNIQUE(contact_id, email_normalized)`, `ON DELETE CASCADE`, single primary; and the scalar `contacts.email` consumers.
- **Contact→leads cascade** in `PATCH /:id` (updates linked `leads` fields) and the async ZB contact sync — must keep firing; the new email logic is additive.
- Existing migrations (025, 079, 129, 130, 143, 154, 155) and their indexes.
- Tenancy guarantees (ONBOARD-FIX-001 / ZB-ISO-001): all reads/writes scoped by `company_id`; the merge introduces no cross-tenant path.

### Out of scope

- Any change to the unified-list query shape or the Pulse timeline-detail projection (they already surface `contact_emails`-linked threads).
- Auto-creating contacts from unknown email recipients (existing behavior stays); CC/BCC-based merge (resolution is on the added address only); phone-side behavior.
- A general-purpose "merge two arbitrary contacts" UI (this feature merges only via the email-add action, per D2's constrained rules); manual conflict-resolution UI.
- Destructive email removal / reverse-merge (FR-8) unless explicitly chosen; changes to the unread model or ZB email push.

## EMAIL-LEAD-ORIGIN-001: email-only Pulse timelines are first-class — show the contact card and let a lead be born from an email (phone optional)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-07-04 · **Owner:** Pulse / Leads / Contacts / Email
**Type:** feature — frontend (ungate the Pulse detail card + phoneless-panel robustness + email-origin lead wizard) + backend (POST /api/leads accepts email/contact_id origin with phone optional; new lead-by-contact_id lookup). Two parts: **PART A** (show the contact card for phoneless timelines) + **PART B** (create a LEAD from an email, phone OPTIONAL). **Binding owner decisions (stated explicitly, no further questions):** the contact card MUST appear for email-only contacts; a lead MUST be creatable from an email; **phone is OPTIONAL** for such leads.

### Duplication check (result)

Not a duplicate — it makes an existing-but-invisible state usable. Adjacent shipped features, none of which cover this:

- **EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 / EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001 / LIST-PAGINATION-001** already surface an email-only conversation in the Pulse unified list (via the email signal / `email_by_contact` CTE), and the contact may already exist (auto-created from an inbound email, or via CONTACT-EMAIL-MERGE-001). But the **Pulse detail card is phone-gated**: `PulsePage.tsx` (~line 361) renders the whole Lead/Contact/Wizard tri-state only when `!isAnonTimeline && (p.contactId || p.timelineId) && p.phone` — and `p.phone` is `''` for an email-only timeline, so an email-only contact shows **no card at all** (no identity, no actions, no way to create a lead). That is the PART A gap.
- **Leads are phone-born.** `CreateLeadJobWizard` (the Pulse "New Lead" wizard) takes a mandatory `phone` prop, initializes its phone field from it, and puts `Phone: toE164(phoneNumber)` into the create payload (and hardcodes `phone` into the ZB customer payload on the with-job leg). `CreateLeadDialog` (the manual reference form) has an Email field but marks `Phone` `required` and validates on it. There is **no way to create a lead from an email without a phone**. That is the PART B gap.
- **Schema is already ready — no storage migration needed.** `leads.phone` is NULLABLE (mig 004), `leads.email` exists (VARCHAR 200), `leads.contact_id` + `idx_leads_contact_id` exist (mig 023). A phoneless, email-origin lead is **storable today**; only the write-path validation, the create wizard, and the lookup block it.

## MAIL-MUTE-001: excluding a sender in Mail Secretary also mutes that sender's EMAIL signal in the Pulse timeline (email channel only; calls/SMS unaffected)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-07-05 · **Owner:** Mail Secretary / Pulse / Email
**Type:** feature — backend-only (extend the inbound-email link path to skip Pulse contribution when a sender matches an existing Mail Secretary exclusion rule; make the Pulse unified-list SQL suppress the EMAIL contribution — surfacing, ordering, unread — for muted senders while leaving CALL and SMS contributions intact). **No new user-facing list, no new input type, no new settings field.** The *existing* Mail Secretary exclusion list is the single source of truth; this feature only widens what a match *means*.

### Problem (owner, verbatim intent)

Adding a sender to the Mail Secretary exclusion list today only stops **task creation**. The inbound email is **still linked** to the sender's contact timeline: it marks the timeline **unread** and **bumps it to the top** of the Pulse list. Vendor/no-reply senders (e.g. `customerservice@relyhome.com` → timeline `/pulse/timeline/2915`) therefore keep cluttering the Pulse list even though the operator has explicitly said "ignore this sender."

### BINDING clarified decisions (from the customer interview — these OVERRIDE any conflicting assumption below)

1. **Granularity = the exclusion DSL's `from:` rule, unchanged.** A muted sender is an exact address (`customerservice@relyhome.com`) OR a domain (`@relyhome.com` / `relyhome.com`). This is already how the `from:` rule works (case-insensitive substring match against `"from_name <from_email>"`; both exact and domain-substring already supported). **No new user input type.**
2. **ONE unified list (critical).** There is **NO** separate "muted senders" list. The **existing** `mail_agent_settings.exclusion_rules` list is the single user-facing list. We EXTEND its meaning: a matching inbound email now ALSO does not update the Pulse timeline (no link / no unread / no bump / no email surfacing), **in addition to** today's "no task."
3. **Channel-specific (critical).** Muting suppresses **only the EMAIL channel**. The same contact's timeline still surfaces AND bumps on inbound **CALLS** and **SMS** normally. For a phone+email contact, the email signal is suppressed in the list but call/SMS signals remain; for an email-only contact (relyhome / timeline 2915) the only signal is email → the timeline drops out of the list.
4. **Existing threads auto-hide.** An already-linked timeline of a now-muted sender is hidden from the list automatically (by suppressing the email contribution in the *list query*), and is reversible when the sender is un-excluded. **No separate manual cleanup** ships as part of this feature; historical `email_messages`/`email_threads` rows are **retained, not deleted** (open in the detail view if navigated to directly).
5. **Agent contact-creation stays blocked for muted senders.** A muted/excluded sender must NOT get a contact auto-created (else the timeline reappears). Already satisfied by the unified approach: the agent returns `skipped_excluded` before its create-contact-for-unknown path.
6. **Reversible & per-company.** Removing the sender from exclusions restores normal email linking/surfacing. All evaluation and suppression are scoped by `company_id`.

### Duplication check (result)

**Not a duplicate — it is a deliberate cross-cut over two shipped features.** Adjacent features and why none of them cover this:

- **MAIL-AGENT-001 (Mail Secretary, deployed prod 2026-07-03, mig 152)** owns the exclusion list and the DSL (`mailAgentRules`: `from:`/`subject:`/`body:`/`any`, substring or `/regex/i`, `-` negation, quotes, `#` comments). `mailAgentService.reviewInboundEmail` (`backend/src/services/mailAgentService.js` l.99–145) evaluates rules via `safeParseRules(settings.exclusion_rules)` + `matchEmail(...)` and returns `{verdict:'skipped_excluded'}` on a hit — **but that verdict ONLY gates task creation.** It does NOT change linking. This feature reuses that exact match to ALSO gate Pulse contribution.
- **EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 / EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001 / CONTACT-EMAIL-MERGE-001 / EMAIL-LEAD-ORIGIN-001** make an email conversation a first-class Pulse citizen (`emailTimelineService.linkInboundMessage`, `email_by_contact` CTE, unread + bump). They deliberately *surface* email — none of them provides a per-sender suppression. This feature adds the missing "suppress this sender's email contribution" seam.
- **LIST-PAGINATION-001** built the single `getUnifiedTimelinePage` query whose email contribution (surfacing predicate, `last_interaction_at`, `any_unread`) is exactly what must become suppressible-per-contact here — without touching the call/SMS contributions it also owns.

There is **no existing "mute" / "suppress sender" feature**; `grep` for `MAIL-MUTE` across `docs/` returns nothing.

### User stories / use cases

1. **US-1 (vendor no-reply, email-only).** As an operator, when I add `customerservice@relyhome.com` (or `@relyhome.com`) to the Mail Secretary exclusion list, future emails from that sender must stop appearing in my Pulse list, and the existing relyhome timeline (2915) must drop out of the list — because its only signal is email.
2. **US-2 (phone+email contact — keep the human channels).** As an operator, if a contact I do business with by phone/SMS *also* receives muted vendor email at their address, muting must remove only the email clutter: their timeline must still surface and bump when they **call** or **text**.
3. **US-3 (un-exclude restores).** As an operator, when I remove a sender from the exclusion list, their emails link and surface normally again, and their previously-hidden email-only timeline reappears in the list.
4. **US-4 (domain vs exact).** As an operator, I can mute one exact address without muting the whole domain, or mute the whole domain — using the same `from:` rule I already use to stop tasks.
5. **US-5 (no accidental contact spawn).** As an operator, muting a previously-unknown sender must not cause a contact/timeline to be auto-created for them by the agent.

### Functional requirements

- **FR-1 — Reuse the existing exclusion match; no new list/field.** Muting is driven entirely by `mail_agent_settings.exclusion_rules` via the existing `mailAgentRules` `from:` semantics. No new column, no new UI list, no new input type is introduced for the *user*. (A derived, queryable representation MAY be added for the SQL path — see Constraint C-1 — but it is not user-facing.)
- **FR-2 — Suppress inbound email→timeline link for muted senders.** In `emailTimelineService.linkInboundMessage` (`backend/src/services/email/emailTimelineService.js` l.89–235), when the sender matches an active exclusion rule for that `companyId`, add an early return of the same shape as the existing branches (e.g. `{skipped:'muted_sender'}`) **before** `findOrCreateTimelineByContact` / `markContactUnread` / `markTimelineUnread`. No link row for the email, no unread flip, no bump.
- **FR-3 — Do not auto-create a contact for muted senders.** Ensure the agent's create-contact-for-unknown-sender path is not reached for a muted sender (already guaranteed by `skipped_excluded` preceding contact creation — verify and keep). A muted first-time sender must NOT materialize a contact/timeline.
- **FR-4 — Suppress ONLY the EMAIL contribution in the Pulse unified list.** In `getUnifiedTimelinePage` (`backend/src/db/timelinesQueries.js`, ~l.381–580), the EMAIL contribution must be suppressed **per contact** for muted senders while CALL and SMS contributions remain: (a) drop `eml.email_thread_id IS NOT NULL` from the surfacing predicate (l.547–551) for muted contacts; (b) exclude the email term from `last_interaction_at = GREATEST(latest_call.started_at, sms.last_message_at, eml.last_message_at)` (l.499) for muted contacts; (c) exclude `COALESCE(eml.unread_count,0) > 0` from `any_unread` (l.500–501) for muted contacts. Calls (`latest_call`), SMS (`sms` lateral), open tasks, `is_action_required`, and `tl.has_unread` contributions are **untouched**.
- **FR-5 — Channel-specific drop-out for email-only timelines.** A timeline whose ONLY signal is email from a muted sender must not satisfy the surfacing predicate → it does not appear in the list. A timeline that also has a call/SMS/open-task/`has_unread` signal remains, ranked by its non-email signals only.
- **FR-6 — Reversible.** Removing the sender from `exclusion_rules` immediately (subject to the settings/derived-set refresh, see C-1) restores link-on-inbound and list surfacing; the historical timeline reappears because its retained email rows again contribute.
- **FR-7 — Per-company scoping.** Exclusion evaluation and list suppression MUST be scoped by `company_id`. A mute in company A never suppresses email in company B (the Pulse query is already `WHERE tl.company_id = $1`; the muted-sender set MUST be company-scoped too).
- **FR-8 — Idempotency / redelivery.** A redelivered or duplicate inbound email for a muted sender must remain suppressed (no link, no unread) and must not create a contact — consistent with the existing provider-message-id dedup; muting must not weaken dedup.
- **FR-9 — Historical rows are retained, not deleted.** Suppression is a *query-time* hide, not a data mutation. Existing `email_messages`/`email_threads`/link rows for a now-muted sender are preserved and remain reachable in the detail view if opened directly; only *list* surfacing/unread/bump are suppressed.
- **FR-10 — Fail-open on mute evaluation.** If the muted-sender check fails (parse error, missing settings, DB error), the pipeline MUST behave as today (link + surface as normal) rather than dropping or erroring the email — mirroring MAIL-AGENT-001's "never throw from the link pipeline" contract. Muting is best-effort clutter-reduction, never a delivery/data-loss risk.

### Edge cases (explicit)

- **Phone+email contact** → email suppressed in list; **call/SMS still surface and bump** (FR-4/FR-5). ✔
- **Email-only contact (relyhome / 2915)** → drops out of the list entirely while muted (FR-5). ✔
- **Un-exclude** → normal linking/surfacing restored, historical timeline reappears (FR-6). ✔
- **Domain vs exact** → `@relyhome.com` mutes all `*@relyhome.com`; `customerservice@relyhome.com` mutes only that address (FR-1). ✔
- **Negation / complex DSL** → a sender matched by a `from:` rule but rescued by a `-` negation on the SAME line is NOT muted (mute follows `matchEmail`'s final `excluded` verdict exactly — no divergent mute logic). ✔
- **Multi-tenant** → mute is company-scoped; no cross-tenant suppression (FR-7). ✔
- **Redelivery/duplicate** → stays suppressed, no contact spawned (FR-8). ✔
- **Outbound reply to a muted sender** → out of scope for suppression; the existing outbound/`draft_or_sent` branches already govern the agent-side projection. If an operator emails a muted address, that is a human action; this feature does not force-surface or force-hide it beyond current EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001 behavior. (Flag for Architect to confirm desired outbound posture — see Open questions OQ-MM-2.)
- **Mid-thread mute** → older emails already linked stay in history (FR-9) but stop contributing to the list once muted; new inbound stops linking (FR-2).

### Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-1 — No Pulse-list latency regression.** `getUnifiedTimelinePage` is the hot Pulse path (PULSE-PERF-001: it was tuned from 8.4s→0.3s with digit indexes). The muted-sender suppression MUST be added without reintroducing a Seq Scan or a per-row regex/CTE blow-up; verify with `EXPLAIN` against a prod-DB copy (methodology per PULSE-PERF-001), not mocked jest.
- **NFR-2 — Bounded per-email overhead.** The mute check on the inbound path must reuse the already-cached settings (`mailAgentService.getActiveState` caches settings ~60s per company) rather than re-reading `mail_agent_settings` on every email.
- **NFR-3 — Data-safe.** No destructive migration on historical email data; suppression is reversible and query-time (FR-9).
- **NFR-4 — Consistency between the two seams.** The inbound-link suppression (JS/DSL) and the list suppression (SQL) MUST agree on "who is muted" for a given company, so a sender never links-but-hides or hides-but-links inconsistently.

### Constraints & dependencies (for the Architect — DO NOT solve here)

- **C-1 (the core tension — flagged as a dependency).** Exclusion rules are evaluated in **JS** (`mailAgentRules` DSL), but the Pulse surfacing is **SQL** (`getUnifiedTimelinePage`). Suppressing the email contribution in SQL based on a JS-DSL requires a **derived, queryable "muted-sender" representation** (e.g. a materialized/derived set of muted email addresses or domains per company kept in sync from `exclusion_rules`, or a per-email `muted` marker stamped at link time on the email/link row). Which representation, how it stays in sync with `exclusion_rules` edits (FR-6 reversibility), and whether it needs migration **156** (next available; latest in repo = **155**) is an **Architect decision** — do not solve in requirements. This is the single biggest design risk; call it out first.
- **C-2 — Reuse `matchEmail`, don't fork mute logic.** The mute decision MUST be the exact `excluded` verdict from `mailAgentRules.matchEmail` (including negation/regex/quotes), so behavior can never diverge from what the operator sees the exclusion list doing for tasks.
- **C-3 — Migration numbering.** IF a derived-set/marker needs schema, next migration = **156** (with matching `rollback_156_*.sql`); latest present = **155**.
- **C-4 — Gate on Mail Secretary being connected.** Muting semantics only apply when the `mail-secretary` marketplace app is connected/enabled for the company (the exclusion list only exists then). When not connected, behavior is exactly today's (email links & surfaces normally).

### Involved modules (per architecture.md)

- **`backend/src/services/email/emailTimelineService.js`** — `linkInboundMessage` gains a `muted_sender` early return (FR-2/FR-3).
- **`backend/src/services/mailAgentService.js`** + **`backend/src/services/mailAgentRules.js`** — source of the mute verdict (`safeParseRules` + `matchEmail`); possibly the place that maintains the derived muted-sender set (C-1).
- **`backend/src/db/timelinesQueries.js`** — `getUnifiedTimelinePage` email-contribution suppression (FR-4/FR-5) + the mark-unread helpers must not flip unread for muted inbound.
- **`backend/src/db/mailAgentQueries.js`** / **`mail_agent_settings`** (mig 152) — settings/`exclusion_rules` source; any derived-set persistence.
- **`backend/db/migrations/156_*.sql`** — only if C-1's representation needs schema.

### Integrations affected

- **Email providers (Gmail Pub/Sub push / IMAP via the MailProvider seam)** — the inbound path that feeds `linkInboundMessage`; behavior narrows (muted senders skip linking) but the provider contract is unchanged.
- **Twilio / telephony (calls & SMS)** — **explicitly UNAFFECTED**; this feature must leave the call and SMS contributions to the Pulse list untouched (the whole point of "channel-specific").
- **Zenbooker / Front / Stripe / VAPI** — untouched.

### Protected parts (MUST NOT break)

- **The `linkInboundMessage` contract & its existing skip branches** (`no_message`/`outbound`/`draft_or_sent`/`no_contact`) and its "never break the pipeline" posture — the mute return is additive and must not throw (FR-10).
- **MAIL-AGENT-001 exclusion semantics** — the DSL, `matchEmail`, and today's `skipped_excluded` task-gating behavior stay intact; mute reuses them, never redefines them.
- **CALL and SMS contributions to `getUnifiedTimelinePage`** — `latest_call`, the `sms` lateral, `open_task`, `is_action_required`, `tl.has_unread`, the orphan-shadow dedup, and pagination correctness (page stays ≤ limit; PULSE-PERF-001 indexes) MUST be preserved exactly.
- **EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001 / EMAIL-LEAD-ORIGIN-001** surfacing for **non-muted** senders — unchanged.
- **Tenant isolation** — the muted-sender set and all suppression stay `company_id`-scoped (no cross-tenant leak).
- **Historical email data** — no deletion/mutation (FR-9); reversibility preserved (FR-6).

### Verification posture

Verify against a **real prod-DB copy**, not mocked jest (LIST-PAGINATION-001 / PULSE-PERF-001 lessons): (a) mute relyhome → confirm timeline 2915 disappears from `getUnifiedTimelinePage` and reappears on un-mute; (b) for a phone+email contact, confirm a new **call/SMS** still surfaces & bumps while a new **email** does not; (c) `EXPLAIN` the modified list query for no Seq-Scan/regex regression; (d) redelivery of a muted email creates no contact and no unread.

### Open questions (for Architect / SpecWriter)

- **OQ-MM-1 — Derived muted-sender representation (C-1).** Materialized set synced from `exclusion_rules`, vs. a `muted` marker stamped on the email/link row at link time, vs. an inline company-scoped address/domain lookup in the SQL. Picks the sync strategy for reversibility (FR-6) and the latency budget (NFR-1). **DECISION OWNER: Architect.**
- **OQ-MM-2 — Outbound-to-muted-sender posture.** Does an operator's outbound email to a muted address surface the timeline (today's EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001) or stay hidden? Default assumption: leave outbound behavior as-is (mute governs the INBOUND email signal only). **Confirm with Product/Architect.**
- **OQ-MM-3 — Snooze/refresh latency on rule edits.** Acceptable staleness between editing `exclusion_rules` and the list reflecting it, given the ~60s settings cache (NFR-2). Assumption: ≤ ~60s is fine (matches task-gating today). **Confirm with Product.**
- **No lead-by-contact_id lookup exists.** Leads are looked up ONLY by phone digits: frontend `useLeadByPhone` / `useLeadsByPhones` (enabled only when a phone is present), backend `leadsService.getLeadByPhone` / `getLeadsByPhones`, routes `GET /api/leads/by-phone/:phone` + `POST /api/leads/by-phones`. So a phoneless contact card **cannot tell whether a lead already exists** for it → it would wrongly offer "create lead" and risk duplicate leads. That is the reason B2 (lead-by-contact_id lookup) is in scope, not optional.

### Description

Make **email-only Pulse timelines** (a contact exists — or is resolvable — but has **no phone**) first-class in two parts.

**PART A — show the contact card for phoneless timelines.** Ungate the Pulse detail card so an email-only timeline shows the same Lead / Contact / "create lead" tri-state a phone timeline shows, driven by contact/timeline identity rather than by a phone. The contact panel and the lead-detail panel must render without a phone and must hide/disable phone-only affordances (the `tel:` link, `ClickToCallButton`, `OpenTimelineButton`, the SMS composer) instead of emitting `tel:`/dialing with an empty string. Email affordances (the `mailto:` link, the email composer) stay.

**PART B — let a lead be born from an email, phone OPTIONAL.** From an email-only contact card, if **no** lead is linked, offer **"create lead from email"**: a lead created with **email + name**, phone **optional/blank**, `contact_id` carried as the origin. The write path (`POST /api/leads`) must accept an **email/contact_id origin** when phone is absent (today it hard-requires phone ≥ 5 chars and its contact-dedup resolves by phone). Because leads can't currently be looked up without a phone, add a **lead-by-contact_id lookup** so the card can detect an already-linked lead and show it (LeadDetailPanel) instead of re-offering the wizard — **preventing duplicate leads**. A lead created email-origin then appears on the **Leads page** (it lists leads independently of phone) and on the **contact** (via `leads.contact_id`), and its Pulse-sidebar signal already surfaces through the email thread.

Phone-origin leads and phone timelines are **unchanged** — this is purely additive: the phone stays optional (nullable) and every existing phone path keeps working.

### User scenarios

1. **Open an email-only timeline → see the contact card.** A dispatcher opens a Pulse conversation that is an email thread whose contact has no phone. Today: no card renders. Now: the detail card appears, showing the contact's name and email (identity), with phone-only actions (call, SMS, dial-timeline) absent — not broken `tel:` links. The email thread and the email composer remain.
2. **The card shows an existing lead if one is linked by contact_id.** The email-only contact already has a lead (created earlier, or email-origin). The card detects it via the new lead-by-contact_id lookup and renders **LeadDetailPanel** (status, actions), exactly as a phone contact with a lead would — it does NOT offer "create lead" again.
3. **No lead yet → offer "create lead from email."** The email-only contact has no linked lead. The card shows the "create lead" affordance (the wizard's email-origin mode), pre-filled from the contact (name + email), phone field blank/optional.
4. **Create a lead from an email with email + name, phone optional.** The dispatcher fills name (email pre-filled), leaves phone blank, and creates. `POST /api/leads` accepts the email/contact_id origin with no phone, stores a lead with `phone` NULL, `email` set, `contact_id` set. No validation error, no fabricated phone.
5. **The phoneless contact panel does not crash and hides/disables phone-only actions.** Rendering `PulseContactPanel` (and `LeadDetailPanel`) for a contact with `phone_e164` NULL does not throw and does not emit `tel:`/`ClickToCall`/`OpenTimeline` with an empty phone; the primary-phone row is omitted (like the already-guarded secondary-phone row); the SMS composer is hidden/disabled; the email row and composer render normally.
6. **A lead created email-origin appears on the Leads page and on the contact.** After creation, the new lead shows on the Leads list (which lists leads independently of phone) and is associated to the contact via `leads.contact_id`; opening the same Pulse timeline now shows LeadDetailPanel (scenario 2). The Pulse-sidebar row for the conversation continues to surface via its **email** signal (no phone signal is expected).

### Functional requirements

- **FR-A1 (ungate the card).** Ungate the Pulse detail-card tri-state so it renders on **identity** (`!isAnonTimeline && (p.contactId || p.timelineId)`) rather than requiring `p.phone`. For an email-only timeline the same branch resolves to LeadDetailPanel (if a lead is linked — see FR-B2) → PulseContactPanel (contact, no lead) → "create lead from email" (no contact-lead). Anonymous timelines stay excluded.
- **FR-A2 (phoneless-panel robustness).** `PulseContactPanel` and `LeadDetailPanel` must render with `phone_e164` NULL/empty without crashing and **must not emit phone-only affordances with an empty value**: the primary-phone row (`tel:` link + `ClickToCallButton` + `OpenTimelineButton`) is omitted when there is no primary phone (mirroring the existing secondary-phone guard); the SMS composer (`SmsForm`) is hidden or disabled when there is no phone target. Email affordances (`mailto:` + email composer, which already resolves the target by contact id) remain. No `tel:`/dial with `''`.
- **FR-B1 (email/contact_id-origin create).** `POST /api/leads` accepts a lead-create with **phone absent** when an **email and/or `selected_contact_id`** origin is present: replace the unconditional "Phone is required (min 5 chars)" rule with "**phone OR email OR contact_id** must be present" (name still required per existing rules), and the contact-resolution step must resolve/attach by **email or contact_id** when phone is absent (it takes phone as mandatory today). The stored lead has `phone` NULL (or blank), `email` set, `contact_id` set. Existing phone-origin creates are unchanged.
- **FR-B2 (lead-by-contact_id lookup).** Add a **lead-by-contact_id** lookup — backend (`leadsService` function + a `GET /api/leads/by-contact/:contactId` route, permission-gated like `by-phone`) and a frontend hook — so the Pulse card can detect an already-linked lead for a phoneless contact and render LeadDetailPanel instead of re-offering the wizard. This lookup drives duplicate-prevention (a lead exists → do not offer "create"). It should mirror the phone-lookup's "actionable/open lead" semantics (the phone lookups already filter out leads whose contact has a job) so the same "is there an open lead" question is answered consistently for email-origin contacts.
- **FR-B3 (wizard phone-optional).** The Pulse "New Lead" creation surface supports an **email-origin mode**: phone becomes **optional** (no mandatory `phone` prop, no required phone field, phone omitted from the payload and from the ZB customer payload when blank); it accepts a `contactId` + email + name origin, pre-fills from the contact, and creates via FR-B1. The existing phone-origin invocation (with a phone) keeps working unchanged. (The manual `CreateLeadDialog` — which already has an Email field and defaults `Status: 'Submitted'` — is the reference for the email-origin field set; whether the same relaxation is applied there is an architect/scoping call, but the Pulse wizard is in scope.)
- **FR-B4 (OPTIONAL — architect's call): Pulse-sidebar lead-signal by contact_id.** An email-origin lead (phone NULL) adds no phone-matched signal to `getUnifiedTimelinePage`'s lead EXISTS subquery (which matches leads by phone digits only). The conversation **already** surfaces via its email signal, and the Leads page lists leads independently, so a contact_id-based lead signal in the sidebar query is **likely unnecessary for v1** and is **flagged for the Architect to decide**. If pursued, it touches the **HOT** `getUnifiedTimelinePage` query (PULSE-PERF-001) and must follow that discipline (EXPLAIN on a prod copy; any index expression = exact predicate copy) — do NOT casually modify it.

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** Opening an email-only timeline (contact exists, `phone_e164` NULL) renders the detail card (not a blank space); the card shows contact identity (name + email) with no `tel:`/call/SMS affordances present and no console error / thrown render.
- **AC-2.** For an email-only contact **with** a linked lead, the card renders LeadDetailPanel (resolved via lead-by-contact_id) and does **not** show the "create lead" affordance; for one **without** a lead, it shows "create lead from email".
- **AC-3.** `POST /api/leads` with a body carrying email + name + `selected_contact_id` and **no phone** returns success and stores a lead with `phone` NULL, `email` set, `contact_id` set (verified in DB). The same request with none of phone/email/contact_id still fails validation.
- **AC-4.** Creating a lead from the Pulse email-origin wizard with a blank phone does not send a phone in the create payload or the ZB customer payload and does not fabricate one; the created lead appears on the **Leads page** and is linked to the contact (`leads.contact_id`).
- **AC-5.** `GET /api/leads/by-contact/:contactId` returns the linked (open) lead for a contact or an empty result when none, company-scoped, permission-gated; the frontend hook drives the card's lead-vs-create decision.
- **AC-6.** Regression: a phone timeline / phone-origin lead behaves exactly as before (card renders, phone actions present, `useLeadByPhone` path intact, `POST /api/leads` with a phone unchanged); no duplicate lead is created for an email-only contact that already has one.
- **AC-7.** Back-compat + tenancy: `leads.phone` stays nullable; all new reads/writes (by-contact lookup, email-origin create) are scoped by `company_id`; no cross-tenant lead read or attach.

### Constraints / non-functional

- **Company scoping is mandatory** on every new leg — the lead-by-contact_id lookup, the email/contact_id-origin resolution, and the create — all filtered by the request's `company_id` (ONBOARD-FIX-001 / ZB-ISO-001 precedents). No cross-tenant lead read, attach, or create.
- **Do NOT casually touch the hot `getUnifiedTimelinePage`** (PULSE-PERF-001). FR-B4 (sidebar lead-signal by contact_id) is optional and the Architect's call; if pursued, follow PULSE-PERF-001 discipline (EXPLAIN on a prod copy; index expression = exact predicate copy). The conversation already surfaces via its email signal, so v1 need not modify the list query.
- **`leads.phone` stays nullable** — no schema change for storage (mig 004 already NULLABLE; mig 023 `contact_id` + `idx_leads_contact_id` present). A migration is expected **only** if the Architect adds a supporting index for the by-contact lookup (there already is `idx_leads_contact_id`, so likely none). Re-verify the current max migration number immediately before creating any (parallel branches); any backfill idempotent + logs affected rows + rollback file; backend is CommonJS.
- **No duplicate-lead creation.** The card MUST check for an existing lead **by contact_id** (FR-B2) before offering the wizard; "create lead from email" is offered only when no (open) lead is linked. The email-origin create path must not create a second lead when one already exists for the contact.
- **Back-compat: phone-origin leads unchanged.** The phone create path, `useLeadByPhone`/`by-phone`/`by-phones`, the existing wizard invocation with a phone, and phone timelines all keep working byte-for-byte; the email-origin behavior is strictly additive (relax "phone required" to "phone OR email OR contact_id", don't remove the phone path).
- **Phoneless robustness, not phone-faking.** Do not synthesize a placeholder phone to satisfy old code paths; omit phone-only UI and omit phone from payloads instead. Empty-string phones must never reach `tel:`, `ClickToCallButton`, `OpenTimelineButton`, or the ZB customer payload.
- **Contact-resolution reuse.** The email/contact_id-origin resolution should reuse the existing contact-dedup/attach primitives (extended to resolve by email or contact_id when phone is absent) rather than a parallel ad-hoc path, keeping the `selected_contact_id` / `contact_update_mode` create semantics intact.
- **Verify against a real DB, not just mocked jest** (LIST-PAGINATION-001 / created_by-FK lessons — jest mocks the DB, so a phoneless-insert or by-contact query bug hides): run the real by-contact lookup and the phoneless create against a prod-DB copy before deploy.
- Deploy to prod only with explicit owner consent (standing rule).

### Involved modules

- **Frontend:** `frontend/src/pages/PulsePage.tsx` (ungate the tri-state at ~line 361; email-origin wizard branch); `frontend/src/hooks/usePulsePage.ts` (drive `lead` for phoneless via lead-by-contact_id instead of `useLeadByPhone`-only; `phone` may be `''`); `frontend/src/components/contacts/PulseContactPanel.tsx` (null-guard the primary-phone row — `tel:` + `ClickToCallButton` + `OpenTimelineButton`); `frontend/src/components/leads/LeadDetailPanel.tsx` (phoneless robustness if it assumes a phone); `frontend/src/components/conversations/CreateLeadJobWizard.tsx` (phone optional / email-origin) with `CreateLeadDialog.tsx` as the email-field reference; a new lead-by-contact_id hook (alongside `useLeadByPhone.ts`); the leads API client; and the SMS composer gating on the Pulse page (hide/disable when no phone).
- **Backend:** `backend/src/routes/leads.js` — `POST /` (validation ~line 202 "Phone is required"; email/contact_id-origin resolution) + a new `GET /api/leads/by-contact/:contactId` route (permission-gated like `by-phone`); `backend/src/services/leadsService.js` — new `getLeadByContact` (mirroring `getLeadByPhone`'s open-lead filter); `backend/src/services/contactDedupeService.js` (`resolveContact` — allow email/contact_id origin when phone absent).
- **Tests:** backend jest for by-contact lookup + phoneless email-origin create (validation branches, company scoping, no-duplicate) **plus** a real-query verification vs a prod-DB copy (documented in the PR); frontend render checks for the phoneless card/panel.

### Integrations

- **Google / Gmail** — the email-only timeline/contact originates from the existing email ingest seam (EMAIL-TIMELINE-001); no Gmail API-surface change. **Zenbooker** — the with-job leg of lead creation must OMIT phone from the ZB customer payload when blank (do not send an empty phone); existing phone-carrying ZB creates unchanged; ZB job creation still needs address.state where applicable (existing behavior). **Twilio / Front / Stripe** — untouched.

### Protected parts (must not break)

- **`getUnifiedTimelinePage` / `email_by_contact` CTE** (PULSE-PERF-001, LIST-PAGINATION-001, EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001) — do not change its shape/semantics; FR-B4 (any sidebar lead-signal by contact_id) is optional and, if done, must follow PULSE-PERF-001 discipline.
- **Phone lead path:** `useLeadByPhone` / `useLeadsByPhones`, `leadsService.getLeadByPhone` / `getLeadsByPhones`, `GET /api/leads/by-phone/:phone` + `POST /api/leads/by-phones`, and the wizard's existing phone invocation — all unchanged; the by-contact lookup is added alongside.
- **`leads.phone` nullable invariant + `leads.contact_id` / `idx_leads_contact_id`** (migs 004, 023) — relied on for storage; no destructive schema change.
- **`POST /api/leads` phone-origin contract** (existing required-field rules for name; `selected_contact_id` / `contact_update_mode` resolution; the async contact→lead cascade and ZB sync) — kept firing; only the phone-mandatory rule is relaxed to phone-OR-email-OR-contact_id.
- **Anonymous-timeline handling** — anon timelines (`isAnonTimeline`) stay excluded from the detail card; ungating keys on contact/timeline identity, not on removing the anon guard.
- **LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001** — the new-leads nav badge counts by status/`lead_lost`, independent of phone; an email-origin lead with a "new" status must be counted the same way (do not regress the badge's status/SSE logic).
- Tenancy guarantees (ONBOARD-FIX-001 / ZB-ISO-001): all new reads/writes scoped by `company_id`.

### Dependencies

- **LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001** — the Leads nav badge / new-count must treat an email-origin lead the same as a phone-origin one (status-based, phone-independent).
- **CONTACT-EMAIL-MERGE-001** — supplies/normalizes the email-only contact (`contact_emails`, `findEmailContact`) that this feature shows a card for and creates a lead from; the email-origin contact this feature resolves against is the one merge produces.
- **EMAIL-TIMELINE-001** (and EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001 / LIST-PAGINATION-001) — provide the email-only timeline and its Pulse-list surfacing (the email signal) that this feature adds a card + lead to.
- **mig 023** (`leads.contact_id` + `idx_leads_contact_id`) — the storage + index the by-contact lookup and email-origin `contact_id` linkage rely on (already present; no new migration expected for storage).

### Out of scope

- Any change to the unified-list query shape / Pulse timeline-detail projection beyond the optional FR-B4 (which is deferred to the Architect and, if taken, is index-only per PULSE-PERF-001).
- A schema/storage migration for phoneless leads (already supported) — a migration only if the Architect adds a supporting index.
- Reworking the manual `CreateLeadDialog` to be phone-optional (the in-scope creation surface is the Pulse email-origin wizard; extending the manual dialog is a separate scoping call).
- Making the browser softphone / SMS work for a phoneless contact (there is no phone target — the affordances are hidden/disabled, not re-engineered); mobile-softphone rules unchanged.
- Auto-creating a lead from an email without a dispatcher action (creation stays explicit via "create lead from email").

## VAPI-SLOT-ENGINE-001: the voice agent (Sara) offers engine-ranked time slots on the call, and the caller's pick becomes a schedule-blocking hold on the lead

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-07-04 · **Owner:** Voice / Schedule / Leads
**Type:** feature — backend (new VAPI tool → `slotEngineService` directly, gated + safe-fail; `createLead` persists the chosen structured slot to `lead_date_time`/`lead_end_date_time`; the engine's occupancy snapshot includes open held leads) + repo config (`voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2.json`: new slot tool-def + scheduling-prompt rewrite). **No frontend change, no migration, no new hold entity, no schedule-render change.** **Binding owner decisions (interview done — stated explicitly, no further questions):** **D1** — offer **2–3 ranked** slots; the caller's chosen slot is saved on the created **LEAD** as a **schedule-blocking hold** (the lead shows in the Schedule at that time and occupies it), **NOT** an auto-created Zenbooker job; a dispatcher **CONFIRMS** (convert lead→job, which carries the slot) or **CANCELS/LOSES** the lead (which frees the slot). **D2** — if **none** of the offered slots suit the caller, the agent goes **deeper** (the tool supports a "give me more / different" mode: exclude already-offered slots and/or extend the date window). **D3** — the location for the slot calc is the **validated address (lat/lng)** if collected during the call, else the **zip** (geocoded to a centroid); if the engine is unavailable **or** the `smart-slot-engine` marketplace app is not connected, **fall back gracefully** to the current behavior (generic windows / callback) and **never crash the call**.

### Duplication check (result)

Not a duplicate — it upgrades one step of an existing, shipped flow and closes a discard. Adjacent features, none of which cover engine-ranked concrete windows offered live + persisted as a hold:

- **LQV2 (Lead Qualifier v2)** already has the `checkAvailability` tool, but it calls `scheduleService.getAvailableSlots(DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID, …)` (`backend/src/routes/vapi-tools.js:126`) — the generic "morning/next-window" path from `dispatch_settings` + booked items, **not** the location-aware ranking engine. LQV2's `createLead` **discards** the caller's pick: `preferredSlot` is only rendered into a text line (`Slot: ${preferredSlot || 'pending callback'}`, `buildCallSummary`, `vapi-tools.js:139/146/170`) in the Comments summary — **no** `lead_date_time`/`lead_end_date_time` is ever set, so the chosen slot never becomes a schedule hold. This feature swaps the engine in and persists the pick.
- **SLOT-ENGINE-001** built the ranking engine (`slot-engine/` service + `slotEngineService.getRecommendations` + the `POST /api/schedule/slot-recommendations` proxy + the `smart-slot-engine` marketplace app, mig 126) — but it is consumed only by the dispatcher UI (`CustomTimeModal` cards), behind auth + `schedule.dispatch`. It has **never** been reachable from the VAPI (server-to-server, no session) call path.
- **Leads-in-Schedule already exists.** Leads carry `lead_date_time` + `lead_end_date_time` (mig 004) and the Schedule grid already UNION-renders leads whose status is not terminal — so setting those two columns makes a lead show as a hold with **no** schedule-render change. This feature only needs to *write* those columns from the VAPI path and add held leads to the *engine's* occupancy (the generic path already subtracts leads).

### Description

Make the VAPI voice agent (**Sara / Lead-Qualifier-v2**) offer the caller **2–3 concrete, engine-ranked arrival windows** during the call — computed by the existing SLOT-ENGINE-001 recommendation engine from the caller's location — instead of the current generic "we have something in the morning" answer. When the caller **picks** a window, the created **lead** is stamped with that structured slot (`lead_date_time` / `lead_end_date_time`), which makes the lead appear on the **Schedule** at that time as a **HOLD that blocks the slot** (leads already render on the grid; open held leads are also added to the engine's occupancy so the same slot is not re-offered to the next caller). The hold persists until a **dispatcher** either **confirms** it (converts the lead → job, which carries the slot into the job's start/end) or **cancels/loses** the lead — both of which drop the lead out of the Schedule and the engine occupancy via the **existing** terminal-status filter, freeing the slot with **no teardown code**.

Concretely: add a **new VAPI tool** (e.g. `recommendSlots` / `getAvailableSlots`) in `backend/src/routes/vapi-tools.js` that calls `slotEngineService.getRecommendations(DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID, { new_job: { … } })` **directly** (the auth'd proxy route cannot be reused), gated on `marketplaceService.isAppConnected(DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID, 'smart-slot-engine')` exactly like the proxy, with the engine's own safe-failure (`recommendations: [], engine_status: 'unavailable'`) mapped to a graceful fallback so the call never breaks. The tool supports a **"deeper"** mode (exclude already-offered slots and/or extend the window) for "none of these work." The existing `createLead` tool is changed to **persist** the caller's chosen structured slot into `lead_date_time`/`lead_end_date_time` (instead of only a Comments label). The **repo** assistant JSON (`voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2.json`) gains the tool definition and a rewritten scheduling-prompt section (offer top 2–3, handle "none suit → deeper," pass the chosen structured slot into `createLead`). Pushing the **live** assistant (PATCH `api.vapi.ai`, assistant `30e85a87`) is a **separate, owner-consent-gated prod step**, like a deploy — this pipeline updates only the repo JSON.

### User scenarios

1. **Caller gives a zip/address → agent offers 2–3 concrete ranked windows.** A caller describes an appliance problem and gives their service address (or just a zip). After qualification, the agent calls the new slot tool; the engine returns ranked windows for that location; the agent reads back the **top 2–3** as concrete windows (e.g. *"Tuesday between 10am and 1pm, or Wednesday 1 to 4"*) — not a vague "morning."
2. **Caller picks a window → lead created with the slot as a schedule-blocking hold.** The caller chooses one window. The agent calls `createLead` carrying the **structured** chosen slot; the lead is stored with `lead_date_time`/`lead_end_date_time` set (plus the usual name/problem/address/source). The lead now appears on the **Schedule** at that time as a hold and occupies the slot.
3. **Caller rejects all offered windows → agent goes deeper.** None of the 2–3 suit the caller ("nothing that week"). The agent re-invokes the slot tool in **deeper** mode — excluding the already-offered slots and/or extending the date window — and offers a fresh 2–3. This can repeat until the caller picks one or the flow ends with a callback.
4. **Engine down / app not connected → graceful fallback, call continues.** The `smart-slot-engine` app is not connected, or the engine returns its safe-failure (`engine_status:'unavailable'` / empty). The tool returns a fallback signal; the agent falls back to the current behavior (generic windows via the existing availability path, or offer a callback) and completes the call and the lead normally. The call **never** crashes on an engine error.
5. **Dispatcher confirms the hold → job takes the slot, hold clears.** A dispatcher reviews the held lead and **converts** it to a job. The slot flows into the job's `start_date`/`end_date` (existing convert behavior); the (now `converted`) lead drops out of the Schedule + engine occupancy via the terminal-status filter, and the job occupies that time — the hold is seamlessly replaced by the booking.
6. **Dispatcher cancels/loses the lead → slot frees.** A dispatcher marks the held lead **lost** (or cancels it). The lead drops out of the Schedule + engine occupancy via the same terminal-status filter, freeing the slot for other callers/jobs. No explicit hold-teardown runs.
7. **Two callers, same window.** Caller A holds Tuesday 10–1. Caller B calls shortly after; because the open held lead is now in the engine's occupancy snapshot, that Tuesday 10–1 window is **not** re-offered to Caller B (or is de-prioritized), preventing a double-hold on the same slot.

### Functional requirements

- **FR-1 (new VAPI slot tool → engine, gated, safe-fail).** Add a new tool handler in `backend/src/routes/vapi-tools.js` (e.g. `recommendSlots`) that calls **`slotEngineService.getRecommendations(DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID, { new_job: { … } })` directly** (NOT the `POST /api/schedule/slot-recommendations` proxy — that needs `authenticate` + `schedule.dispatch`). It is **gated** on `marketplaceService.isAppConnected(DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID, marketplaceService.SMART_SLOT_ENGINE_APP_KEY)` (the app key resolves to `smart-slot-engine`; same gate the proxy applies at `schedule.js:203`); when the app is not connected, or the engine returns its safe-failure shape (`{ recommendations: [], summary: null, engine_status: 'unavailable', coverage }`), the tool returns a **fallback** result the assistant can act on (e.g. `{ slots: [], fallback: true }` or the generic-window slots) rather than an error — the call must never break. On success the engine returns `engine_status: 'ok'` with `recommendations`. The tool offers at most **2–3** slots (respect the engine's own `recommendations_shown`/`settings.horizon_days` and cap to 3), each carrying the fields the assistant needs to (a) speak the window and (b) pass a structured slot back into `createLead`.
- **FR-2 (location = validated address else zip centroid).** The tool builds `new_job` from the **validated address (lat/lng)** when collected during the call, else from the **zip** (the engine geocodes an address / accepts lat/lng and can fall to a zip centroid). It sets a sane `job_type` + `duration_minutes` (reuse the LQV2 appointment-duration constant / engine defaults) and an `earliest_allowed_date`/`latest_allowed_date` window. `exclude_job_id` is N/A (there is no existing job for a prospective caller).
- **FR-3 ("deeper" / more-slots mode).** The tool accepts a **"give me more / different"** mode so that, when the caller rejects the offered set, it returns a fresh 2–3 by **excluding already-offered slots** (the assistant passes back what was already offered — e.g. offered date+window keys — to be filtered out) **and/or extending the date window** (later `latest_allowed_date` / a later `earliest_allowed_date`). Repeatable within the call. The exact "exclude" contract (what the assistant echoes back and how the tool filters) is pinned by the Architect/Spec.
- **FR-4 (`createLead` persists the chosen structured slot as a hold).** The `createLead` handler (`vapi-tools.js`) must, when the caller has chosen a slot, **persist** the chosen structured slot into the lead's **`lead_date_time`** and **`lead_end_date_time`** columns (mig 004) — replacing today's behavior where `preferredSlot` is only rendered into the Comments summary text. The chosen slot is passed as **structured** data (start/end derived from the recommendation's `date` + window), not a free-text label. When the caller did **not** pick a concrete slot (callback / fallback), the columns stay NULL (today's Comments-label behavior may remain for context). Setting these columns is what makes the lead a schedule-blocking hold — **no** new hold entity, **no** schedule-render change.
- **FR-5 (engine occupancy includes open held leads).** The engine's occupancy/busy snapshot — `slotEngineService.buildScheduledJobs(companyId, startDate, endDate, tz, excludeJobId)` (today built from **jobs only**, via `jobsService.listJobs`, `slotEngineService.js:112`) — must **also** include **open leads that carry a `lead_date_time`** and are **not** in a terminal status (the **same** `status NOT IN ('converted','lost','spam')` filter the leads-in-Schedule UNION uses — `scheduleQueries.js:136`, **lowercase, verbatim**), mapped into the engine's `lat`/`lng`/window/`duration_minutes`/status shape (derive `duration_minutes` from `lead_date_time`→`lead_end_date_time`), so a caller's hold **blocks re-offering** that window to the next caller. (The generic `scheduleService.getAvailableSlots` path already subtracts leads+tasks — only the **engine** path needs this add.) Confirmed/lost leads fall out of this snapshot automatically via the status filter. Note a lead needs `latitude`/`longitude` (or a geocodable address) to enter the geo-occupancy — a hold with no coordinates cannot participate; the Architect decides whether to geocode-on-hold or accept that gap for v1.
- **FR-6 (repo assistant tool-def + scheduling-prompt rewrite).** In `voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2.json`: add the new slot tool to `model.tools[]` in the **same shape** as the existing tools (`function: { name, description, parameters }`, `server: { url, secret }`), and **rewrite** the scheduling section of the system prompt so the agent (a) calls the new engine tool instead of the generic `checkAvailability` path, (b) offers the **top 2–3** concrete windows, (c) on "none suit," re-invokes the tool in **deeper** mode, (d) on fallback/engine-down, degrades to generic windows / callback, and (e) passes the **chosen structured slot** into `createLead`. This updates **only the repo JSON**; see the constraint on the live push.

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** With `smart-slot-engine` **connected**, a slot-tool call for a valid location returns **≤ 3** engine-ranked slots, each with enough structure to both speak the window and reconstruct a start/end for the lead; the assistant offers the top 2–3.
- **AC-2.** After the caller picks a slot and `createLead` runs, the created lead row has **`lead_date_time` and `lead_end_date_time` set** (verified in DB) to the chosen window, and the lead **appears on the Schedule** at that time (existing lead-render), occupying the slot. No fabricated/placeholder slot when the caller did not pick one (columns NULL).
- **AC-3.** A **deeper** call (caller rejected the first set) returns a fresh set that **excludes** the previously-offered slots and/or covers a **later** window; the same already-offered slot is not returned twice.
- **AC-4.** With `smart-slot-engine` **not connected** — or when the engine returns its safe-failure (`engine_status:'unavailable'` / empty) — the tool returns a **fallback** (never throws), the assistant degrades to generic windows / callback, and **the call completes** and a lead is still created (slot columns NULL). No unhandled error reaches the call.
- **AC-5.** With a held lead (carrying coordinates) occupying a window, a **second** slot-tool call for an overlapping location/time does **not** re-offer that same window (the open held lead is in the engine occupancy). Once the held lead is **converted** or **lost**, a subsequent call **can** offer that window again (it left the occupancy via the `NOT IN ('converted','lost','spam')` filter).
- **AC-6.** Dispatcher **converts** the held lead → the job carries the slot into `start_date`/`end_date` (existing convert), the lead leaves the Schedule/occupancy, the job occupies the time. Dispatcher **loses/cancels** → the slot frees. Neither requires any new hold-teardown code.
- **AC-7.** `voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2.json` in the repo contains the new tool in `model.tools[]` (correct `function`/`server` shape) and a scheduling prompt that offers top 2–3 + deeper + fallback + structured-slot-into-`createLead`. The **live** assistant is unchanged by this pipeline (push is a separate owner-gated step).
- **AC-8.** Single-tenant + auth invariants hold: the new tool and the `createLead` slot write use `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` (seed …0001) like the other VAPI tools; the endpoint stays behind `x-vapi-secret` (fail-closed) and is **not** exposed via the auth'd proxy.

### Constraints / non-functional

- **No migration, no new hold entity, no schedule-render change.** `lead_date_time`/`lead_end_date_time` (mig 004) already exist and the Schedule grid already UNION-renders non-terminal leads; the hold is **just a lead with those columns set**. (If the Architect adds a supporting index for the leads-in-occupancy read, re-verify the current max migration number immediately before creating it — parallel branches; backfill idempotent + logs rows + rollback file; backend is CommonJS. None is expected — `lead_date_time` reads are date-windowed and small.)
- **Do NOT reuse the auth'd proxy.** `POST /api/schedule/slot-recommendations` requires `authenticate` + `requireCompanyAccess` + `schedule.dispatch`; VAPI is server-to-server with no session. The new tool calls `slotEngineService.getRecommendations` **directly** and re-implements the **same** `isAppConnected(…, 'smart-slot-engine')` gate the proxy applies. Do not weaken the proxy's auth to share it.
- **Company hardwired to the seed, like the other VAPI tools.** The new tool and the slot-persisting `createLead` use the existing `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` constant (seed UUID ending `0001`) — single-tenant at the vapi-tools layer, consistent with `checkServiceArea`/`validateAddress`/`checkAvailability`/`createLead`. Tenant context is the VAPI assistant assignment, not a session (do not add per-request company inference here).
- **Safe-failure never crashes the call.** Map the engine's `{ recommendations: [], engine_status: 'unavailable' }` (and the not-connected gate, and any thrown error) to a **fallback** tool result; the assistant degrades to generic windows / callback. Lead creation must never be blocked by the slot tool (LQV2 rule: lead creation never blocks call completion). Tool p95 target unchanged (< 2000ms); the engine call must respect a timeout and fall back on slowness.
- **The hold is a lead in a non-terminal status carrying `lead_date_time`; confirm/cancel free it via existing status filters.** Do not build hold lifecycle/teardown: a converted lead (via `convertLead`, which already carries `zb_job_payload.timeslot.start/end` → the job's `start_date`/`end_date`, `leadsService.js:757/631`) or a lost/cancelled lead leaves both the Schedule render and the engine occupancy through the **same** terminal-status filter. Mirror the **exact** leads-in-Schedule set **verbatim** — `status NOT IN ('converted','lost','spam')` (lowercase, `scheduleQueries.js:136`) — in the occupancy add; do **not** use the capitalized `('Lost','Converted')` set from the lead-by-phone/contact lookups (a different code path) or invent a different set, or a lead will render as a hold but not block re-offering (or vice-versa).
- **Persist a structured slot, not a text label.** The chosen slot must reach `lead_date_time`/`lead_end_date_time` as real timestamps derived from the recommendation's `date` + window (company-local), **not** a free-text "Slot: …" string. The Comments summary line may remain for human context, but it is **not** the source of the hold.
- **Engine output shape must be pinned before implementation.** The raw engine (`slot-engine/src/engine.js:184`) returns each recommendation as `{ rank, candidate_id, date, techId, techName, time_frame:{start,end}, feasible_arrival_interval:{start,end}, metrics, score, confidence, requires_dispatch_confirmation?, reason_codes, explanation }` (windows are company-local `HH:MM`); the load-bearing per-slot fields for a hold are **`date` + `time_frame.{start,end}`** (compose `lead_date_time`/`lead_end_date_time` from `date` + window in the company timezone). The `slotEngineService.getRecommendations` **wrapper** returns `{ recommendations, summary, engine_status:'ok'|'unavailable', coverage }` (`slotEngineService.js:150/228`) and may reshape each recommendation; the Architect/Spec must **pin the wrapper's exact per-slot output** by reading the service + the frontend `slotRecommendationsApi` / `CustomTimeModal` cards that consume it — the tool maps from that wrapper shape, not the raw engine directly.
- **Live VAPI push is a separate owner-gated prod step.** Editing the live assistant (`30e85a87`) via `PATCH api.vapi.ai` is a prod change requiring explicit owner consent per deploy (like any deploy). Follow the VAPI-edit discipline: `get` first (the live agent **drifts**), edit via REST PATCH (the CLI `update` panics), and re-inject `VAPI_TOOLS_SECRET` into every `model.tools[].server` on any model write. Keep `answerOnBridge="true"` on the Dial (unrelated but a known foot-gun). This pipeline changes **only** the repo JSON.
- **Verify against a real DB / real engine, not just mocked jest.** Jest mocks the DB (LIST-PAGINATION-001 / created_by-FK lessons — a slot-persist or occupancy-read bug hides): run the **real** `createLead` slot write and the **real** engine-with-held-leads occupancy against a prod-DB copy, and exercise the tool end-to-end against the real slot engine, before any deploy.
- Deploy to prod (and the live VAPI push) only with explicit owner consent (standing rule).

### Involved modules

- **Backend:** `backend/src/routes/vapi-tools.js` — new slot-tool handler (`recommendSlots`, gated + safe-fail + deeper mode) + dispatcher routing; `createLead` handler changed to persist the chosen structured slot to `lead_date_time`/`lead_end_date_time` (drop the discard-into-Comments-only behavior for the pick). `backend/src/services/slotEngineService.js` — reused via `getRecommendations` for a prospective caller (no existing job); **`buildScheduledJobs` extended** to include open non-terminal leads carrying `lead_date_time` in the occupancy snapshot (the only occupancy change). `backend/src/services/marketplaceService.js` — reused (`isAppConnected(…, 'smart-slot-engine')` gate). `backend/src/services/leadsService.js` — the create/convert path that stores `lead_date_time`/`lead_end_date_time` and (on convert) carries the slot into the job start/end (reused; `convertLead` already carries the slot). `backend/src/services/scheduleService.js` — unchanged (its `getAvailableSlots` stays the fallback path and already subtracts leads).
- **Occupancy/schedule read:** the leads-in-Schedule UNION (`backend/src/db/scheduleQueries.js`) is the **reference** for the exact non-terminal lead-status filter to mirror in the occupancy add — read it, don't guess.
- **Repo config:** `voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2.json` — `model.tools[]` (add the slot tool, same `function`/`server` shape) + system-prompt scheduling section rewrite.
- **Tests:** backend jest for the slot tool (gated / safe-fail / deeper), the `createLead` slot-persist, and the occupancy-includes-held-leads read (validation + company scope) **plus** a real-DB-copy + real-engine verification documented in the PR.

### Integrations

- **VAPI** — the live assistant (`30e85a87`) gains the slot tool + scheduling prompt, but **only via the separate owner-gated `PATCH api.vapi.ai` step**; this pipeline touches only the repo JSON. **SLOT-ENGINE-001 / `smart-slot-engine`** — the recommendation engine + its marketplace-connected gate are the new dependency the tool calls (directly, not via the proxy). **Zenbooker** — untouched by the tool; only the **existing** convert path (`convertLead`) carries the slot into the ZB/job payload → `start_date`/`end_date` (existing behavior, and ZB job-create still needs a phone + `address.state` where applicable). **Google Maps Geocoding** — reused by the engine to turn an address/zip into coordinates (existing engine behavior; the LQV2 `validateAddress` already provides the validated address). **Twilio / Front / Stripe** — untouched.

### Protected parts (must not break)

- **VAPI tool auth + envelope + single-tenant contract** — `x-vapi-secret` vs `VAPI_TOOLS_SECRET` (fail-closed), the `message.toolCallList[].function {name, arguments-JSON}` → `{results:[{toolCallId, result-JSON}]}` envelope, and the hardwired `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` — the new tool follows all three exactly; do not add auth/session to `/api/vapi-tools` or expose the slot engine via the auth'd proxy.
- **Existing VAPI tools** (`checkServiceArea`, `validateAddress`, `checkAvailability`, `createLead`) — keep working; `checkAvailability` stays as the **fallback** availability path (its `scheduleService.getAvailableSlots` behavior unchanged); `createLead`'s existing fields/summary/retry/"never block the call" semantics are preserved — the **only** `createLead` change is adding the structured-slot write to `lead_date_time`/`lead_end_date_time`.
- **`slot-engine/` service + `slotEngineService.getRecommendations` I/O contract + the `POST /api/schedule/slot-recommendations` proxy + `CustomTimeModal`** — the engine's algorithm/output contract and the dispatcher UI path are untouched; the **only** service change is `buildScheduledJobs` adding held leads to occupancy (an occupancy input, not a contract/scoring change) — do not alter scoring, ranking, config, or the recommendation output fields.
- **`leads.lead_date_time` / `lead_end_date_time` (mig 004) + the leads-in-Schedule UNION render + its non-terminal status filter** — relied on for the hold; no schema change, no render change; mirror the existing status filter verbatim in the occupancy add.
- **`convertLead` slot-carry + terminal-status drop-out** — convert already carries the slot into the job and a `converted`/`lost` lead already leaves the Schedule; do not add teardown that could double-handle it.
- **Live VAPI assistant `30e85a87`** — not modified by this pipeline; any live change is the separate owner-gated PATCH with the `get`-first / re-inject-`VAPI_TOOLS_SECRET` / keep-`answerOnBridge` discipline.
- Tenancy/isolation posture — the tool operates only within `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID`; no cross-tenant read/write is introduced.

### Dependencies

- **SLOT-ENGINE-001** — the recommendation engine (`slot-engine/` + `slotEngineService.getRecommendations` + the `smart-slot-engine` marketplace app, mig 126) the new tool calls directly; its wrapper output shape + safe-failure (`{ recommendations:[], summary:null, engine_status:'unavailable', coverage }`) must be pinned by the Architect/Spec. **Merged on master** (Phase 1–3); this feature's worktree branch already contains it.
- **LQV2 (Lead Qualifier v2 assistant)** — the assistant this feature extends (the scheduling tool + prompt, `createLead`, the `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` + `x-vapi-secret` conventions, the appointment-duration constant); the repo JSON is `voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2.json`, the live agent is `30e85a87`.
- **`smart-slot-engine` marketplace app** — the connected-state gate (`isAppConnected`) that must be present for the tool to use the engine; not-connected ⇒ graceful fallback.
- **mig 004 (leads scheduling columns `lead_date_time` / `lead_end_date_time`)** — the storage the hold is written to (already present; no new migration expected).

### Out of scope

- Auto-creating a Zenbooker **job** from the call (D1: the call creates only a **held lead**; a dispatcher's convert makes the job).
- Any change to the Schedule render, a new "hold" entity/table, or a migration for holds (the hold is a lead with `lead_date_time` set).
- Changing the slot engine's scoring/ranking/config or its recommendation output contract (only its occupancy **input** gains held leads).
- The **live** VAPI push (separate owner-gated prod step) and any change to other VAPI tools beyond the `createLead` slot-write.
- Reworking the generic `scheduleService.getAvailableSlots` / `checkAvailability` path (it remains the untouched fallback) and the dispatcher-facing `CustomTimeModal` / proxy path.
- Multi-technician team holds, and any frontend change (this feature is backend + repo-config only).

## AGENT-SKILLS-001: Agent-agnostic CRM skill layer + existing-customer voice skills (P1–P3) + MCP surface

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-07-04 · **Owner:** Voice / CRM / Platform
**Type:** feature — backend (a NEW provider-neutral CRM **skill/capability layer** holding all skill logic + server-side verification gating; the existing `/api/vapi-tools` refactored into a THIN adapter; a NEW MCP surface exposing the same skills; write-through to Zenbooker for reschedule/cancel; audit note on every write) + repo config (`voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2.json` scheduling/routing prompt so Sara branches existing-vs-new). **No frontend change and no new data model are required for the skills themselves** (P1–P3 are a read/route layer + two guarded writes over existing services); the Architect confirms whether any supporting index/migration is needed (none is expected).
**Source of truth for the skills:** `voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v3-crm-roadmap.md` (carries FR-C1…FR-C8, the L0/L1/L2 verification model, `status_map`, the security rules, and the P1/P2/P3 phasing — all restated and superseded where the interview decided otherwise).

**Binding owner decisions (interview done — these OVERRIDE any conflicting roadmap assumption):**
- **D1 — Scope = ALL skills.** P1 (`identifyCaller` enhance, `getCustomerOverview`, `getJobStatus`, `getAppointments`) + P2 (`rescheduleAppointment`, `cancelAppointment` retention-gated) + P3 (`getJobHistory`, `getEstimateSummary`, `getInvoiceSummary`). Ship in phase order (P1 first — highest value, lowest risk), but all are in scope for this feature.
- **D2 — THE core architectural principle: the voice agent must be SWAPPABLE for any other agent, and everything keeps working — therefore ALL skill logic lives INSIDE the CRM application, not in the voice agent.** Concretely: a provider-neutral CRM **skill/capability layer** (services holding the logic + verification gating), exposed via TWO thin adapters built in this feature — (a) a provider-neutral REST surface, with the existing `/api/vapi-tools` refactored into a **thin adapter** that only translates VAPI's envelope to/from the skill layer; and (b) a **NEW MCP server** exposing the SAME skills, so any MCP-capable agent connects without re-implementing anything. VAPI/Sara is ONE consumer among several. **No business logic in the VAPI adapter or the MCP adapter — both call the same skill layer.**
- **D3 — Write skills write to the Albusto schedule AND push to Zenbooker** (ZB is still master for jobs), mirroring the existing "`scheduleService`→ZB push" pattern already used by `cancelJob` and `reassignItem`. **Every write records an audit note attributed to "AI Phone".**
- **D4 — Verification is enforced SERVER-SIDE in the skill layer, NEVER trusted to the LLM.** L0 (no match → new-lead flow), L1 (phone match → low-sensitivity reads: next appointment window, job-status phrase), L2 (confirmed name AND ZIP/address → writes + sensitive reads: history, estimate/invoice summaries). **No payment capture by voice, ever** (offer secure link or human). **Company isolation** (scope every query to the caller's company; the voice/MCP surface hardwires `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID`) is a **P0 invariant** — any cross-customer / cross-company disclosure is a **P0 defect**.
- **D5 — Naming.** The internal system is now called **Albusto** (not "Blanc"). Code identifiers (`blanc_status`, `BLANC_STATUSES`, `--blanc-*`) stay as-is; prose/user-facing/spoken text uses "Albusto".

### Duplication check (result)

**Not a duplicate; it is a refactor + extension that unifies three existing pieces and adds one new surface.** Adjacent features:

- **LQV2 (`## LQV2`)** introduced `/api/vapi-tools` (`vapiSecretAuth`, `x-vapi-secret`/`VAPI_TOOLS_SECRET` fail-closed, hardwired `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID`, the `toolCallList → results` envelope) and the live tools `checkServiceArea`/`validateAddress`/`checkAvailability`/`createLead`. This feature **refactors that endpoint into a thin adapter** and moves logic into the skill layer — it does NOT re-implement those tools' behavior, only relocates the seam.
- **VAPI-SLOT-ENGINE-001 (`## VAPI-SLOT-ENGINE-001`)** added `recommendSlots` (VAPI tool → `slotEngineService.getRecommendations` directly, gated on `isAppConnected(…, 'smart-slot-engine')`, safe-fail) and the `createLead` slot-persist. Its conventions (direct-service call, marketplace gate, graceful fallback, single-tenant hardwire, live-push-is-owner-gated) are the exact precedent this feature follows.
- **`identifyCaller` is specified in the v3 roadmap but is NOT yet implemented** in `backend/src/routes/vapi-tools.js` (current live handlers: `checkServiceArea`, `validateAddress`, `checkAvailability`, `recommendSlots`, `createLead`; the roadmap header's `live_tools` also omits it). So `identifyCaller` is **introduced** by this feature as a skill (built on `leadsService.getLeadByPhone`/`getLeadsByPhones` + a contacts/timeline phone match) — there is no duplicate handler to remove; the brief's "already exists" is imprecise. (Note: `leadsService.getLeadByPhone` today returns `null` when the matched contact already has a job — precisely the existing-customer case — so identity resolution for the skill must NOT reuse that "open-lead-only" filter verbatim; the Architect resolves identity across leads **and** contacts/jobs. See Constraints.)
- **CRM-SALES-MCP (`## CRM-SALES-MCP Cross-stage Requirements`, Status: Implemented and audited)** already ships a **working, hand-rolled JSON-RPC MCP server** in the repo (`backend/src/routes/crmMcp.js` authenticated JSON-RPC at `/api/crm/mcp`; `backend/src/routes/crmMcpPublic.js` token-gated public HTTP + legacy SSE at `/mcp/crm`; `backend/src/cli/crmMcpStdio.js` stdio) built from a reusable stack: `crmMcpToolRegistry` (read/write tool defs, `requiresConfirmation`, `requiredPermission`), `crmMcpSchemaValidator` (runtime arg validation), `crmMcpToolExecutor` (`buildContext` → companyId from `req.companyFilter.company_id`, write-permission + confirmation gates, dispatch to services), `crmMcpResponse` (sanitized MCP responses + error→HTTP mapping), `crmMcpProtocolService` (JSON-RPC), `crmMcpPublicAuth` (bearer token + env-bound company context, writes disabled unless explicitly enabled). **The new MCP surface (AR-3) MUST reuse this established pattern (a parallel voice/CRM tool registry + executor over the SAME skill layer), NOT invent a second MCP framework.** This is a strong reuse target, not a duplicate: CRM-SALES-MCP exposes the *sales* CRM (accounts/deals/pipeline); AGENT-SKILLS exposes the *service* CRM skills (identify/status/appointments/reschedule/cancel/estimate/invoice).

### 1. Problem

~50% of inbound calls are **existing customers** — asking about a job's status, an appointment window, a reschedule or cancel, or "how much was my estimate / what's my balance." Today the voice agent (Sara / Lead-Qualifier-v2) has only the new-lead qualification flow, so it **mis-qualifies existing customers as new leads** (re-collecting appliance/ZIP/fee on someone who already has an open job) — wrong, slow, and erosive of trust. Separately, all of Sara's call logic that touches the CRM lives (or would live) in VAPI tool handlers, which **couples the CRM to one voice provider**: if Sara is swapped for another agent, the capabilities would have to be re-implemented.

### 2. Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**
- Recognize an existing caller and branch into a CRM-aware flow (status/appointments/reschedule/cancel/estimate/invoice) instead of the new-lead flow, with server-side verification gating.
- Put **all** skill logic in a **provider-neutral CRM skill layer** so the voice agent is swappable and any MCP-capable agent gets the same capabilities.
- Refactor `/api/vapi-tools` into a **thin adapter** (envelope translation only) over the skill layer, preserving its auth/envelope/single-tenant contract.
- Add a **new MCP surface** (reusing the `crmMcp*` pattern) exposing the same skills.
- Write skills reschedule/cancel **write Albusto + push Zenbooker** and **record an "AI Phone" audit note** every time.

**Non-goals (out of scope)**
- Taking a card / capturing payment by voice — **ever** (offer a secure link or a human).
- Creating estimates/invoices by voice; auto-creating a Zenbooker **job** by voice.
- Multi-company / multi-tenant routing at the voice/MCP layer (single-company: `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID`).
- Warm transfer to a human with context (tracked separately); outbound calls (different assistant type).
- Any change to the slot engine's scoring/ranking, the dispatcher UI, or the generic `checkAvailability` fallback path.
- Reworking the CRM-SALES-MCP sales tools; this feature adds a **parallel** service-CRM tool set over the same MCP framework.

### 3. User stories

1. **Existing customer, phone matches (L1).** A known customer calls from a number on file; the agent silently identifies them, greets by name, and answers "where's my appointment / what's the status" from L1 reads — without new-lead qualification.
2. **Existing customer, masked/spoofed number.** The number doesn't match (lead-gen masking). The agent asks name + service ZIP/street, resolves the customer within ~2 questions, and (with confirmed name AND ZIP) reaches L2 for writes/sensitive reads.
3. **Truly new caller (L0).** No match → the agent runs the existing v2 new-lead flow (`createLead → Review`) unchanged.
4. **Reschedule (L2 write).** A verified customer moves their appointment; the agent offers 2–3 windows, confirms old→new, and the change writes to the Albusto schedule **and** pushes to Zenbooker, with an "AI Phone" audit note; it appears on the dispatcher schedule immediately.
5. **Cancel (L2 write, retention-gated).** A verified customer wants to cancel; the agent captures a reason, makes exactly **one** genuine save attempt, and only then cancels (Albusto + ZB), recording the reason as an "AI Phone" audit note.
6. **Estimate/invoice (L2 sensitive read).** A verified customer asks "how much was my estimate / what's my balance"; the agent speaks a **summary** (status, total, balance), offers to text a secure link, and never reads line items or takes a card.
7. **Swap the agent.** The voice provider is replaced (or an internal MCP-capable agent is added); because all logic is in the skill layer exposed over MCP, the new agent gets identify/status/appointments/reschedule/cancel/estimate/invoice with **no CRM code changes** — only a new thin adapter/connection.
8. **Error on any skill.** A CRM read/write errors internally; the skill returns a safe "let me have a teammate follow up" shape (never an internal error/stack/PII), the call continues, and nothing is disclosed.

### 4. Functional requirements

#### 4.1 Architecture requirements

- **AR-1 — Provider-neutral CRM skill layer (all logic + server-side verification).** Introduce a CRM **skill/capability layer** (one or more services, e.g. a `voiceSkills`/`agentSkills` service module) that holds **all** skill logic and the **server-side** verification gating (L0/L1/L2). Each skill is a plain async function `skill(companyId, args, context)` that (a) enforces its required verification level against a server-derived `verification`/`context` (NOT an LLM-asserted flag), (b) scopes every query to `companyId`, (c) calls the existing services (§Constraints), and (d) returns a **provider-neutral, speech-safe result object** (no raw PII dumps, no internal codes, no stack traces). The layer is the SINGLE source of truth; both adapters (AR-2, AR-3) call it. No skill trusts the caller/LLM for verification, company, or entity ownership.
- **AR-2 — `/api/vapi-tools` refactored to a THIN adapter (ZERO business logic).** Refactor `backend/src/routes/vapi-tools.js` so each tool handler only: parse the VAPI envelope (`message.toolCallList[].function {name, arguments-JSON}`), map arguments to the skill's inputs, call the corresponding **skill-layer** function with `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` + a server-built context, and map the skill's result back into `{results:[{toolCallId, result-JSON}]}`. **No CRM logic, no verification decision, no SQL, no service composition remains in the adapter.** The endpoint keeps its exact contract: `vapiSecretAuth` / `x-vapi-secret` vs `VAPI_TOOLS_SECRET` (fail-closed — 503 unconfigured, 401 mismatch), multi-tool `toolCallList` handling, hardwired `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` (`vapi-tools.js` line 27), mounted without `authenticate`/`requireCompanyAccess` (`src/server.js` ~line 219). Existing tools (`checkServiceArea`, `validateAddress`, `checkAvailability`, `recommendSlots`, `createLead`) are moved onto the skill layer without behavior change (their existing "never block the call" / retry / fallback semantics preserved).
- **AR-3 — NEW MCP server exposing the SAME skills (reuse the `crmMcp*` pattern).** Add an MCP surface for the service-CRM skills, **modeled on the existing, audited CRM-SALES-MCP stack** — a parallel tool **registry** (skill tool defs with `kind` read/write, `requiresConfirmation` on writes, per-tool required verification level), the **schema validator** (runtime arg validation), an **executor** that builds a company/verification context and dispatches to the **same skill-layer functions** (NOT to a copy of the logic), the **response** sanitizer (error→sanitized-MCP mapping), and the **protocol** service (JSON-RPC). Expose it over the same transport shapes the CRM MCP uses: an authenticated JSON-RPC route and a **token-gated public transport with env-bound company context** (`crmMcpPublicAuth`-style: bearer token, `*_ENABLED`/`*_WRITE_ENABLED` flags, **writes disabled unless explicitly enabled**), plus stdio if warranted. **No business logic in this adapter.** Company context comes from the env-bound/config context (never client payload), consistent with the CRM MCP's `req.companyFilter.company_id` rule. (Whether this is a new mount like `/api/agent-skills/mcp` + `/mcp/agent-skills`, or additional tools registered under the existing surface, is the Architect's call — but the framework and its tenant/auth/write/confirmation/sanitization contracts are reused, not reinvented.)
- **AR-4 — Write-through to Zenbooker for reschedule/cancel.** Reschedule and cancel write the Albusto schedule/job **and** push to Zenbooker (ZB remains master for jobs), mirroring the existing push pattern. **Cancel already pushes to ZB** (`jobsService.cancelJob` → `zenbookerClient.cancelJob(zenbooker_job_id)` with `forceSyncOnZbError` recovery, line 1225) — the cancel skill reuses it. **Reschedule is a GAP that must be closed:** `scheduleService.rescheduleItem` (lines 141–186) today writes only the Albusto DB + an internal `job_rescheduled` provider push and does **NOT** call Zenbooker, even though `zenbookerClient.rescheduleJob(id, data)` (POST `/jobs/{id}/reschedule`, line 372) exists. The Architect must wire the ZB reschedule push into the reschedule path (mirroring `cancelJob`'s pre-check + `forceSyncOnZbError` discipline, and the `reassignItem`→`zenbookerClient.assignProviders` best-effort pattern). ZB writes target the default company's ZB account (`getClient()` bound to `ZENBOOKER_DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` = seed …0001, same as `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID`; `getClientForCompany` returns null for non-default tenants — ZB-ISO-001).
- **AR-5 — Audit note on every write.** Every write skill (reschedule, cancel; and any note the flow records) writes an **audit note attributed to "AI Phone"** on the job, via `jobsService.addNote(jobId, text, attachments=[], author='AI Phone', createdBy='AI Phone')` (which also mirrors the note text to ZB when the job is linked). Additionally emit a domain event via `eventService.logEvent(companyId, 'job', jobId, <event>, {…}, actorType='system')` so the write is auditable in entity history. The cancel note MUST include the captured reason and record that a retention attempt was made.
- **AR-6 — Company isolation + verification enforced server-side (P0).** Every skill scopes all reads/writes to `companyId` (all reused services already accept `companyId`; pass the hardwired `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` for the voice/MCP surface). Verification (L0/L1/L2) is decided **in the skill layer** from server-derived signals (a real phone match; a server-confirmed name+ZIP/address), **never** from an LLM/caller-supplied "verified: true". Sensitive reads and all writes MUST re-check the required level server-side on each call. A cross-customer or cross-company disclosure/mutation is a **P0 defect**.

#### 4.2 Per-skill functional requirements (one FR per tool)

Each skill states: inputs → outputs, **required verification level**, the **CRM service(s) it reuses**, and its **guardrails** (from the roadmap). All outputs are provider-neutral and speech-safe; internal `blanc_status` is never returned raw (always mapped via `status_map`).

- **FR-S1 — `identifyCaller` (read, L0→resolves level).** *(roadmap FR-C1)*
  - **Inputs:** `phone?`, `name?`, `zip?`, `street?`. **Outputs:** `matchType ∈ new|existing|ambiguous`, `contactId?`, `customerName?`, `verificationLevel (L0|L1|L2)`, `ambiguousCount?`. Never a raw PII dump.
  - **Reuses:** `leadsService.getLeadByPhone` / `getLeadsByPhones`; contacts + timeline phone match (`contactsService`, timelines phone lookup) to resolve **existing customers with jobs** (do NOT rely on `getLeadByPhone` alone — it returns null once a job exists). Resolution order: (1) silent phone lookup from call metadata; (2) if no match/masked, ask name + ZIP/street and look up; (3) disambiguate multiple matches (e.g. by last appointment date / address).
  - **Verification produced:** phone-only match ⇒ **L1**; confirmed name AND (ZIP or street) ⇒ **L2**; no match ⇒ **L0** (new-lead flow). The level is computed and returned by the server; downstream skills re-verify.
  - **Guardrails:** masked number → ask name+ZIP rather than assume new; ambiguous → disambiguate before proceeding; identity lookup tolerant of masked/spoofed numbers and fuzzy name / normalized phone+ZIP.
- **FR-S2 — `getCustomerOverview` (read, L1).** *(FR-C2)* **In:** `contactId`. **Out:** `openJobsCount`, `nextAppointment` (window), `lastJobStatus` (phrase), `hasOpenEstimate`, `hasUnpaidInvoice` — **no amounts, no addresses.** **Reuses:** `jobsService.listJobs({contactId, onlyOpen})`, `scheduleService.getScheduleItems`. **Guardrails:** one-line snapshot to route the call; multiple open jobs → ask which appliance/service to scope.
- **FR-S3 — `getJobStatus` (read, L1).** *(FR-C3)* **In:** `contactId`, `jobId?`. **Out:** `jobId`, `serviceName`, `statusLabel` (mapped phrase), `statusStage`, `appointmentWindow`, `technicianEtaText`. **Reuses:** `jobsService.getJobById`/`listJobs`, `BLANC_STATUSES` (line 25) mapped to a caller phrase via `status_map`; optionally `getJobTransitions` to drive the next offer. **Guardrails:** never read internal `blanc_status` aloud; drive next action from stage (Scheduled→offer reschedule; On-the-way/Enroute→ETA "the tech will text before arriving"; Waiting for parts→set expectation; Done→offer review/new job).
- **FR-S4 — `getAppointments` (read, L1).** *(FR-C8)* **In:** `contactId`. **Out:** `appointments[] = {jobId, serviceName, date, window, statusLabel}`. **Reuses:** `scheduleService.getScheduleItems` + `jobsService.listJobs`. **Guardrails:** window stated as a **range**; never promise an exact minute.
- **FR-S5 — `rescheduleAppointment` (write, L2).** *(FR-C6)* **In:** `contactId`, `jobId`, `newPreferredSlot`. **Out:** `success`, `newWindow`, `conflict?`. **Reuses (read):** `scheduleService.getAvailableSlots` (or the `recommendSlots`/engine path) to offer 2–3 windows. **Reuses (write):** `scheduleService.rescheduleItem('job', jobId, start, end)` **+ ZB push (AR-4 gap to close)** + `jobsService.addNote(author='AI Phone')` (AR-5). **Guardrails:** confirm old→new **before** writing (no write without explicit confirmation of the new window); on conflict offer the next window; reschedule must appear on the dispatcher schedule immediately.
- **FR-S6 — `cancelAppointment` (write, L2, retention-gated).** *(FR-C7)* **In:** `contactId`, `jobId`, `reason`, `retentionAttempted`. **Out:** `success`, `status`. **Reuses:** `jobsService.cancelJob(jobId)` (already ZB-pushing) + `jobsService.addNote(reason, author='AI Phone')` (AR-5). **Guardrails (mandatory order):** acknowledge + **require a reason**; make **exactly one** genuine save attempt matched to the reason (timing→offer a better/sooner window via reschedule; price→restate the \$95-credit / no-full-prepayment protection; found-someone→trust/anti-scam framing + soonest slot; fixed-itself→note/easy rebook); only if they still insist → cancel with `retentionAttempted=true`. **Never cancel on first ask**; reason captured on the job note every time; state any cancellation-policy/fee wording **before** writing (see OQ-V3-2, still open). Cancel reflected in CRM + dispatcher schedule.
- **FR-S7 — `getJobHistory` (read, L2).** *(FR-C4)* **In:** `contactId`, `jobId`. **Out:** `timeline[] = {date, event, note_summary}` — summarized for speech. **Reuses:** `jobsService` notes + `eventService.getEntityHistory(companyId,'job',jobId, notes)`. **Guardrails:** **redact internal-only / technician-private notes**; summarize, don't read raw; L1 callers must verify to L2 before any history is shared.
- **FR-S8 — `getEstimateSummary` (read, L2).** *(FR-C5)* **In:** `contactId`, `jobId?`, `estimateId?`. **Out:** `estimateNumber`, `status`, `total`, `itemCount`, `summaryText`. **Reuses:** `estimatesService.listEstimates(companyId, …)` / `getEstimate(companyId, id)`. **Guardrails:** spoken **summary** only; **do not read every line item**; offer to text a secure link (sender/number = OQ-V3-4, still open); amounts only after **L2**.
- **FR-S9 — `getInvoiceSummary` (read, L2).** *(FR-C5)* **In:** `contactId`, `invoiceId?`. **Out:** `invoiceNumber`, `status`, `total`, `amountPaid`, `balanceDue`. **Reuses:** `invoicesService.listInvoices(companyId, …)` / `getInvoice(companyId, id)`. **Guardrails:** state balance + status; **for payment, hand off to a secure link or a human — never collect a card by voice**; amounts only after **L2**.

**`status_map` (internal `BLANC_STATUSES` → caller-friendly phrase; carry from roadmap; never read codes aloud):** `Submitted`→"We've got your request and are getting it scheduled." · `Review`→"Our team is reviewing the details and will confirm shortly." · `Scheduled`→"You're scheduled — a technician is set for your window." · `Enroute`/`On the way`→"Your technician is on the way." · `In Progress`→"The technician is working on it now." · `Waiting for parts`→"We're waiting on a part to finish the repair." · `Job is Done`→"The job is complete." · `Canceled`→"That appointment is canceled." (Architect reconciles this map against the ACTUAL `BLANC_STATUSES` in `jobsService.js` line 25 — `['Submitted','Waiting for parts','Follow Up with Client','Visit completed','Job is Done','Rescheduled','Canceled','On the way']` — which differs from the roadmap's illustrative set; add phrases for `Follow Up with Client`, `Visit completed`, `Rescheduled` and map any ZB substatus like `en-route`.)

### 5. Non-functional requirements

- **Latency:** skill/tool round-trip **p95 < 2000 ms** (CRM reads are heavier than v2; index `contactId`/phone lookups; the engine/ZB calls must respect a timeout and fall back on slowness).
- **Graceful degradation:** on ANY error, a skill returns a safe result ("let me have a teammate follow up") — **never** an internal error, stack, SQL, or PII; the call continues; lead creation / call completion is never blocked (LQV2 rule). Mirror `crmMcpResponse`'s sanitized-error mapping on the MCP surface.
- **Identity tolerance:** identity lookup is fast and tolerant of masked/spoofed numbers — fuzzy name, normalized phone/ZIP; a masked-number existing customer is found via name+ZIP within ~2 questions.
- **Security/privacy (hard rules):** verification gates enforced **server-side** in the skill layer; **no payment capture by voice, ever**; address/PII is **confirm-only** ("is this still the Walpole Street address?" → yes/no), never read the full address back unprompted; every write logs an "AI Phone" audit note + domain event; **company isolation is absolute** (a cross-customer/cross-company incident is P0). Public MCP transport keeps **writes disabled unless explicitly enabled** and is bearer-token + env-bound-company gated (CRM-MCP precedent).
- **Availability:** ≥ the existing VAPI/backend posture; concurrent inbound calls ≥ 10 (LQV2).

### 6. Acceptance criteria (carry the roadmap's checkboxes)

- **AC-1 (FR-C1):** A caller with an open job is **never** pushed through new-lead qualification; a truly new caller still flows to v2 (`createLead → Review`); a masked-number existing customer is found via name+ZIP within 2 questions.
- **AC-2 (FR-C2/C3):** Internal `blanc_status` is **never** read aloud (always mapped via `status_map`); with multiple open jobs the agent asks which appliance/service to scope; each status yields a correct phrase + sensible next action.
- **AC-3 (FR-C8):** Appointment window is stated as a **range**; ETA is framed as "the tech will text before arriving."
- **AC-4 (FR-C6):** No reschedule write occurs without explicit confirmation of the new window; the reschedule writes Albusto **and** pushes to Zenbooker and appears on the dispatcher schedule immediately; an "AI Phone" audit note is recorded.
- **AC-5 (FR-C7):** Exactly **one** retention attempt precedes any cancel; a **reason is captured** on the job note every time; `retentionAttempted=true`; cancel is reflected in CRM + dispatcher schedule + ZB; an "AI Phone" audit note (with reason) is recorded.
- **AC-6 (FR-C4):** Internal/technician-private notes are **never** read aloud; L1 callers are asked to verify (to L2) before any history is shared.
- **AC-7 (FR-C5):** **No** card/payment capture by voice under any path; estimate/invoice **amounts only after L2**; the agent offers a text-a-link instead of reading line items.
- **AC-8 (verification, server-side):** A skill call asserting `verified:true` from the client/LLM without a server-side match+confirmation is **rejected** for L2 reads/writes (verification is not client-trusted).
- **AC-9 (isolation, P0):** Every skill call is scoped to `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID`; no skill can read or mutate another customer's or another company's data (verified with a cross-tenant attempt test).
- **AC-10 (swappability / MCP):** The same skills are reachable over BOTH the refactored `/api/vapi-tools` thin adapter and the new MCP surface, producing equivalent results; the MCP surface reuses the `crmMcp*` framework (registry/validator/executor/response/protocol) and its tenant/auth/write/confirmation/sanitization contracts; public MCP writes are disabled unless explicitly enabled.
- **AC-11 (thin adapter):** `backend/src/routes/vapi-tools.js` contains **no** CRM business logic, verification decisions, or SQL after the refactor — each handler only translates the envelope and calls a skill-layer function; existing tools keep their behavior (regression-tested).
- **AC-12 (graceful degradation):** Injecting an error into any skill yields a safe "teammate will follow up" tool result (no internal detail leaked) and the call continues.
- **AC-13 (repo config):** `voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2.json` (repo) routes existing-vs-new correctly (identify first, branch), offers the new skills, and passes only skill-shaped arguments; the **live** assistant is unchanged by this pipeline (live PATCH = separate owner-gated step).

### 7. Constraints & dependencies

**Reuse these existing services (do NOT re-implement their logic in the skill layer — call them; all accept `companyId`):**
- `leadsService` (`backend/src/services/leadsService.js`) — `getLeadByPhone(phone, companyId)` (l.1104), `getLeadsByPhones(phones, companyId)` (l.1041), `createLead(fields, companyId)` (l.312), `convertLead(uuid, overrides, companyId)` (l.704), `getLeadById(id, companyId)` (l.283). **Caveat:** `getLeadByPhone` returns `null` when the matched contact already has a job — so identity for existing customers must resolve across **contacts/jobs**, not just open leads.
- `contactsService` (`backend/src/services/contactsService.js`) — `listContacts({search, companyId, providerScope})` (l.50), `getContactById(id, companyId, providerScope)` (l.128), `getContactLeads(contactId, companyId)` (l.169), `getContactEmails(contactId, primaryEmail)` (l.195). (No native phone getter — use leads/timeline phone match to bridge phone→contact.)
- `jobsService` (`backend/src/services/jobsService.js`) — `listJobs({contactId, onlyOpen, companyId, …})` (l.622), `getJobById(id, companyId, providerScope)` (l.589), `addNote(jobId, text, attachments, author, createdBy, noteId)` (l.1157; ZB-mirrors text when linked), `cancelJob(jobId)` (l.1225; **already ZB-pushes**), `updateBlancStatus(jobId, newStatus, companyId)` (l.849), `getJobTransitions(companyId, currentState, userRoles)` (l.1369); constants `BLANC_STATUSES` (l.25), `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` (l.37). **Do not remove/alter statuses, `OUTBOUND_MAP`, or the Zenbooker sync block** (FSM dual-source; jobsService is authoritative fallback).
- `scheduleService` (`backend/src/services/scheduleService.js`) — `getScheduleItems(companyId, filters, providerScope)` (l.74), `getAvailableSlots(companyId, {…})` (l.407), `rescheduleItem(companyId, entityType, entityId, newStartAt, newEndAt)` (l.141 — **does NOT push to ZB today; AR-4 gap**), `reassignItem(companyId, entityType, entityId, assignees)` (l.202 — pushes to ZB via `zenbookerClient.assignProviders`, the write-through precedent).
- `estimatesService` — `listEstimates(companyId, filters)` (l.106), `getEstimate(companyId, id)` (l.110). `invoicesService` — `listInvoices(companyId, filters)` (l.33), `getInvoice(companyId, id)` (l.40).
- `eventService` (`backend/src/services/eventService.js`) — `logEvent(companyId, aggregateType, aggregateId, eventType, eventData, actorType='system', actorId)` (l.21), `getEntityHistory(companyId, aggregateType, aggregateId, entityNotes)` (l.74), `actorName(req)`.
- `zenbookerClient` (`backend/src/services/zenbookerClient.js`) — `rescheduleJob(id, data)` (l.372, POST `/jobs/{id}/reschedule` — **to be wired into the reschedule path**), `cancelJob(id)` (l.362, already used), `addJobNote(id, {text})` (l.392), `assignProviders(id, data)` (l.382); `getClient()` bound to `ZENBOOKER_DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` (l.36 = seed …0001), `getClientForCompany(companyId)` returns null for non-default tenants (ZB-ISO-001).
- `marketplaceService` (`backend/src/services/marketplaceService.js`) — `isAppConnected(companyId, appKey)` (l.93); app keys `SMART_SLOT_ENGINE_APP_KEY='smart-slot-engine'` (l.19), `TELEPHONY_TWILIO_APP_KEY='telephony-twilio'` (l.64), `GOOGLE_EMAIL_APP_KEY='google-email'` (l.25). Architect decides the marketplace gate for the voice-skill surface (e.g. telephony-connected), following the `recommendSlots`→`smart-slot-engine` gate precedent + graceful fallback when not connected.

**Reuse the existing MCP framework (AR-3) — do NOT build a second one:** `backend/src/routes/crmMcp.js`, `crmMcpPublic.js`, `backend/src/cli/crmMcpStdio.js`, and services `crmMcpToolRegistry.js`, `crmMcpSchemaValidator.js`, `crmMcpToolExecutor.js`, `crmMcpResponse.js`, `crmMcpProtocolService.js`, `crmMcpPublicAuth.js` (CRM-SALES-MCP, Status: Implemented and audited; 16 suites / 105 tests). Mirror their read/write kinds, `requiresConfirmation`, per-tool `requiredPermission`/verification, tenant-from-context (`req.companyFilter.company_id`, never client), sanitized errors, and public-transport write-disabled-by-default posture.

**Repo config (this pipeline updates the repo JSON only):** `voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2.json` — add the new skill tool-defs to `model.tools[]` (same `function`/`server` shape as the existing five, `server.url` = `https://api.albusto.com/api/vapi-tools`, secret placeholder injected at push) and rewrite the routing/scheduling prompt so Sara identifies first and branches existing-vs-new. The **live** assistant (`30e85a87`) is a **separate owner-consent-gated PATCH** (get-first; live agent drifts; CLI `update` panics — use REST PATCH; re-inject `VAPI_TOOLS_SECRET` into every `model.tools[].server`; keep `answerOnBridge="true"`).

**Integrations affected:** **VAPI** (Sara is one consumer; live push owner-gated). **Zenbooker** (reschedule/cancel write-through + note mirror; default-company ZB account only; ZB job-create/reschedule needs `address.state` where applicable). **Twilio / telephony-twilio** (the inbound call path + marketplace gate candidate). **Google Maps Geocoding** (reused by `validateAddress`/engine for masked-number ZIP/address resolution). **MCP clients** (any MCP-capable agent connects to the new surface). **Front / Stripe** — untouched (payment stays a secure-link/human handoff).

**Protected parts (must not break):**
- VAPI tool **auth + envelope + single-tenant contract** — `vapiSecretAuth`/`x-vapi-secret` vs `VAPI_TOOLS_SECRET` (fail-closed), the `toolCallList → results` envelope, hardwired `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID`, endpoint mounted without session auth. The refactor relocates logic but preserves every one of these.
- Existing VAPI tools (`checkServiceArea`, `validateAddress`, `checkAvailability`, `recommendSlots`, `createLead`) — behavior preserved (moved onto the skill layer without semantic change; `recommendSlots` gate + safe-fail and `createLead` retry/slot-persist unchanged).
- The **CRM-SALES-MCP** stack and its `/api/crm/mcp` + `/mcp/crm` contracts — reused, not modified; the new surface is additive.
- `jobsService` FSM constants + `OUTBOUND_MAP` + Zenbooker sync/pass-through actions; `scheduleService` generic availability path; `leadsService.createLead(fields, companyId)` signature; ZB-ISO-001 (default-company ZB binding).
- Tenancy/isolation posture — the skills operate only within `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID`; no cross-tenant read/write is introduced.

**Verify against a real DB / real ZB — not just mocked jest** (LIST-PAGINATION-001 / created_by-FK lessons): run the real identity lookup, the real reschedule (Albusto write + ZB push) and cancel, and the real estimate/invoice reads against a prod-DB copy, and exercise both adapters (VAPI envelope + MCP JSON-RPC) end-to-end, before any deploy. **Prod deploy and the live VAPI push are owner-consent-gated (standing rule).**

### 8. Open questions (roadmap OQ-V3-1…5) — DECIDED vs still OPEN

- **OQ-V3-1 — Verification strength for L2 writes.** **DECIDED (interview):** L2 = confirmed **name AND (ZIP or address)**; no last-4/booking-code required. Enforced server-side.
- **OQ-V3-2 — Cancellation policy/fee wording the bot must state before canceling.** **STILL OPEN** (Ops) — for the Architect/SpecWriter to pin the exact policy/fee text (if any) the cancel skill states before writing.
- **OQ-V3-3 — Reschedule write-target while Zenbooker is live.** **DECIDED (interview):** reschedule writes Albusto **AND pushes to Zenbooker** (ZB still master). Note the implementation **gap**: `scheduleService.rescheduleItem` must be extended to call `zenbookerClient.rescheduleJob` (AR-4).
- **OQ-V3-4 — Secure-link texting for estimates/invoices (which sender/number).** **PARTIALLY OPEN** — DECIDED that **no payment/card is taken by voice** (offer a secure link or a human); **still OPEN** which sender/number sends the link (Ops/Eng), for the Architect/SpecWriter.
- **OQ-V3-5 — Whether an existing-customer status/reschedule call ever creates a Review lead (vs only updating the job).** **STILL OPEN** (Product) — default posture is "update the job, do not spawn a Review lead," but the final rule is for the Architect/SpecWriter/Product to confirm.

### 9. Involved modules (summary)

- **New:** provider-neutral CRM **skill/capability layer** service(s) (AR-1); a **service-CRM MCP surface** reusing the `crmMcp*` framework (AR-3) — registry + executor + transport(s) over the same skills.
- **Refactor:** `backend/src/routes/vapi-tools.js` → thin adapter (AR-2). `backend/src/services/scheduleService.js` `rescheduleItem` → add ZB reschedule push (AR-4).
- **Reused unchanged (called by the skill layer):** `leadsService`, `contactsService`, `jobsService`, `estimatesService`, `invoicesService`, `eventService`, `scheduleService` (reads), `zenbookerClient`, `marketplaceService`, and the `crmMcp*` framework services.
- **Repo config:** `voice-agent/assistants/lead-qualifier-v2.json` (routing/scheduling prompt + tool-defs; live push separate/owner-gated).

## EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 — Render inbound email bodies in the Pulse timeline as sanitized HTML (2026-07-06)

**Status:** Requirements (Product/Agent-01). New feature (no existing coverage — dedup checked: `grep EMAIL-HTML-RENDER docs/requirements.md` = none). Extends the read/render surface of **EMAIL-TIMELINE-001** (§ above, line 1955); does **not** touch its OAuth/sync/send paths.

### Problem statement

Inbound emails in the Pulse timeline (`frontend/src/components/pulse/EmailListItem.tsx`) render as **plain text only** — `email.body_text` inside a `<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">` (l.81–88, comment "Text-only — no HTML render (v1)"). Rich emails therefore collapse into a wall of text with **non-clickable links** and no formatting. The canonical example is Google Local Services lead emails (`customer-request-…@awexpress.google.com`) at `/pulse/timeline/3044`: on prod each carries ~39 KB of HTML with buttons and links, all of which the agent currently cannot click. This costs the agent time on exactly the highest-intent inbound (new leads).

The HTML is **already available and already safely rendered elsewhere**: `email_messages.body_html` (TEXT) is populated for 499/500 recent inbound (Gmail sync extracts both `text/plain` and `text/html` — `emailSyncService.js` extractBody ~l.56–73; stored via `emailQueries.js` upsert ~l.295–318), and the separate `/email` workspace already renders it with `DOMPurify.sanitize(...)` in `frontend/src/components/email/EmailMessageItem.tsx` (l.87–97). This feature brings that same sanitized-HTML render into the timeline bubble, behind a shared sanitizer, for **inbound emails only**, with the security posture made explicit.

### Binding decisions (from the customer interview — these OVERRIDE any conflicting assumption downstream)

- **D1 — Inbound only.** Rich sanitized-HTML render applies to **INBOUND** emails only. **Outbound** emails keep their current plain-text render (see D4 fallback for their linkification).
- **D2 — Inline, no height cap.** The sanitized HTML renders **fully inline** in the timeline bubble with **NO `max-height`** and **NO expand/collapse**. Width MUST stay contained: `overflow-x: auto` + a `max-width` + CSS scoping/containment so a wide (~600 px) marketing email cannot break the app layout or leak its styles into the app chrome.
- **D3 — Remote images blocked by default.** Remote (`http`/`https`) images do **NOT** load on initial render (privacy / no tracking-pixel beacon). A per-email **"Show images"** control loads them on demand (Gmail-style). Handling of inline `cid:` and `data:` images is the Architect's call (see OQ-1); remote-by-default = blocked is **binding**.
- **D4 — Plain-text fallback = linkify.** When an email has no `body_html` (the ~1/500 inbound case, and ALL outbound), render `body_text` but **linkify** URLs / email addresses / phone numbers into clickable `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`. Implement with a **small in-repo regex helper** — **NO new dependency**.
- **D5 — One shared sanitizer.** A single shared `SafeEmailHtml` helper/component with **one** DOMPurify config, reused by BOTH the timeline bubble (`EmailListItem`) and the existing workspace (`EmailMessageItem`). Config: strip `script`/`on*`/forms/`iframe` (DOMPurify defaults), **force every `<a>` to `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`**, block `javascript:` and `data:` URLs.
- **D6 — Backend passes `body_html`.** Add `body_html` to the timeline email item shape (the ~3 timeline SELECTs + the `EmailTimelineItem` type + the service/route mappings). **NO migration** (column already exists). Tenant scoping unchanged (all reads already company-scoped). **Keep `body_text`** (fallback + the `body_text ILIKE` search path must not break).

### User stories / use cases

1. **US-1 (agent, Google LSA lead).** As an agent viewing `/pulse/timeline/3044`, I see the inbound Google Local Services email rendered with its real formatting and **clickable** links/buttons, so I can open the lead action directly instead of copy-pasting a URL out of a text wall.
2. **US-2 (agent, privacy).** As an agent opening an inbound marketing/lead email, remote images do **not** load automatically (so the sender gets no read-beacon), and I can click **"Show images"** to load them when I choose to.
3. **US-3 (agent, plain-text inbound).** As an agent viewing an inbound email that has no HTML part, I still get a clean plain-text render whose URLs, emails, and phone numbers are clickable.
4. **US-4 (agent, outbound).** As an agent, my own sent (outbound) emails keep rendering as plain text (with links clickable per D4), matching how I composed them.
5. **US-5 (security / whole company).** As the business, a malicious or malformed inbound email (embedded `<script>`, `onerror=`, a login `<form>`, a `javascript:` link, a 39 KB+ blob, unclosed tags) is **sanitized before render** and can neither run script, exfiltrate, phish, nor break/re-style the Pulse app.
6. **US-6 (agent, workspace parity).** As an agent, the `/email` workspace continues to render bodies exactly as before (or strictly safer), because it now shares the same sanitizer — no regression.

### Functional requirements

- **FR-1 — Sanitized inbound HTML in the timeline bubble.** For an **inbound** email with non-empty `body_html`, `EmailListItem` renders `SafeEmailHtml(body_html)` (sanitized) instead of the plain-text `<p>`. *(D1, D2, D5)*
- **FR-2 — Shared `SafeEmailHtml` helper/component.** Introduce ONE shared frontend helper/component that wraps a SINGLE DOMPurify config and is imported by BOTH `EmailListItem` (timeline) and `EmailMessageItem` (workspace). No second/divergent DOMPurify config remains in the app. *(D5)*
- **FR-3 — Single hardened DOMPurify config.** The shared config: relies on DOMPurify defaults to strip `script`, event handlers (`on*`), `<form>`/form controls, and `<iframe>`; **forces every `<a>` to `target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener noreferrer"`** (via a DOMPurify `afterSanitizeAttributes` hook or equivalent); **blocks `javascript:` and `data:` URLs** on links. *(D5, security)*
- **FR-4 — Layout containment (no leak, no break).** The rendered HTML is wrapped in a scoped container with `overflow-x: auto`, a bounded `max-width`, and style-containment so wide content scrolls **inside its own bubble** and the email's `<style>`/class rules cannot restyle the app. **No `max-height`; no expand/collapse** (inline, full height). *(D2)*
- **FR-5 — Remote images blocked by default + "Show images".** On initial render, remote (`http`/`https`) `<img>` (and any remote-fetching CSS `url(...)` where feasible) do **not** load. A per-email **"Show images"** affordance, when clicked, re-renders with remote images allowed. State is per-email/per-view (not persisted server-side in v1). *(D3)*
- **FR-6 — Plain-text linkify fallback.** When `body_html` is absent/empty (inbound ~1/500) OR the email is **outbound**, render `body_text` through a small in-repo regex linkifier that converts URLs, email addresses, and phone numbers into `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`, preserving existing line-break behavior (`whitespace-pre-wrap`). The linkifier escapes text first (no HTML injection via the plain-text path). **No new dependency.** *(D4)*
- **FR-7 — Outbound stays plain text.** Outbound emails do NOT get the sanitized-HTML render; they use FR-6 (plain-text + linkify) regardless of whether a `body_html` exists. *(D1, D4)*
- **FR-8 — Backend surfaces `body_html` on the timeline item.** Add `body_html` to: (a) the ~3 timeline read SELECTs in `backend/src/db/emailQueries.js` (~l.517, l.548, l.595) that today select `body_text`/`snippet`; (b) the item mappings in `backend/src/services/email/emailTimelineService.js` (l.70, l.477, l.498) and `backend/src/routes/pulse.js` (~l.314); (c) the `EmailTimelineItem` TS type in `frontend/src/types/pulse.ts` (~l.39). **No migration.** *(D6)*
- **FR-9 — Preserve `body_text` and its uses.** `body_text` remains on the item (it is the FR-6 fallback and the outbound render source). `body_text` continues to be quote-stripped via `toTimelineBody(...)`; **`body_html` is passed RAW** (full, un-quote-stripped) to the sanitizer. The `body_text ILIKE` search path in `emailQueries.js` (~l.158) is **not** modified. *(D6, see OQ-2)*
- **FR-10 — Workspace parity via the shared sanitizer.** `EmailMessageItem` is refactored to consume `SafeEmailHtml`, keeping its existing `body_text` `<pre>` fallback; net render is unchanged or strictly safer (forced link `rel`/`target`, remote-image blocking now also applied there). *(D5, backwards-compat)*

### Non-functional requirements

**Security (PRIMARY — this feature intentionally renders attacker-controlled HTML):**

- **NFR-SEC-1 — Sanitize-then-render, always.** No inbound HTML is ever inserted into the DOM without passing through the shared DOMPurify config first. `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` receives ONLY `DOMPurify.sanitize(...)` output. This is the app's accepted approach (DOMPurify 3.2.7 already a dependency; no CSP/helmet, no sandboxed iframes anywhere — sanitization is the control).
- **NFR-SEC-2 — Script/handler/form/iframe stripping.** `<script>`, inline event handlers (`on*`), `<form>`/inputs/buttons-as-submit, and `<iframe>` are removed (DOMPurify defaults); verified by test with a malicious sample.
- **NFR-SEC-3 — Forced safe links.** Every surviving `<a>` has `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` (no reverse-tabnabbing / referrer leak); `javascript:` and `data:` link URLs are blocked.
- **NFR-SEC-4 — No tracking beacons by default.** Remote images do not load until the agent opts in (FR-5), so merely opening the timeline does not notify the sender.
- **NFR-SEC-5 — Multi-tenant isolation unchanged.** All timeline reads remain company-scoped exactly as today; `body_html` is surfaced only through the same already-scoped queries. No new cross-tenant surface. A cross-tenant leak here is P0.
- **NFR-SEC-6 — Fail-safe on sanitizer error.** If sanitization throws or input is unusable, the bubble falls back to the plain-text (FR-6) render rather than rendering raw HTML or crashing the timeline.

**Performance:**

- **NFR-PERF-1 — Large-HTML inline in a list.** Rendering ~39 KB (allow headroom to a few hundred KB) of sanitized HTML inline inside a virtualized/long timeline must not visibly jank the list. Sanitize once per item (memoize by message id + images-shown flag), not on every re-render/scroll.
- **NFR-PERF-2 — No layout thrash.** Because there is no height cap (D2), tall emails are allowed; the container must not force synchronous reflow of the whole timeline on toggle (Show images / expand of adjacent items).

**Compatibility / reliability:**

- **NFR-COMPAT-1 — Workspace unchanged-or-safer.** `/email` (`EmailMessageItem`) render output is unchanged for benign mail and strictly safer for hostile mail after adopting the shared sanitizer; no visual regression on normal emails.
- **NFR-COMPAT-2 — Backward-compatible payload.** Adding `body_html` is additive; older cached clients ignoring the field keep working (they fall back to `body_text`). `body_text` is never removed from the payload.
- **NFR-A11Y-1 — Links & controls accessible.** The "Show images" control is a real focusable button with a label; linkified/HTML links are keyboard-reachable.

### Edge cases (explicitly in scope to handle)

- **EC-1 — No `body_html` (inbound ~1/500).** Fall back to FR-6 plain-text linkify.
- **EC-2 — Malformed / unclosed / huge HTML.** DOMPurify normalizes; container containment prevents layout break; NFR-SEC-6 fail-safe covers a hard failure.
- **EC-3 — Emails with `<style>` / class rules.** Containment/scoping (FR-4) prevents style leakage into the app; author styles apply only within the bubble.
- **EC-4 — Emails with `<form>` / `<script>` / `on*`.** Stripped (NFR-SEC-2).
- **EC-5 — `data:` URI vs remote images.** Remote blocked by default (D3/FR-5); `data:`/inline `cid:` handling deferred to Architect (OQ-1) — note `data:` on **links** is blocked (FR-3), the question is only about `data:`/`cid:` on **images**.
- **EC-6 — Outbound email.** Plain text + linkify (FR-7), never sanitized-HTML render.
- **EC-7 — Empty body (no html AND no text).** Render nothing for the body (current bubble already guards `hasBody`); timestamp/subject still show.
- **EC-8 — Quote-collapsing mismatch.** `body_text` is quote-stripped but `body_html` is raw/full — a long inbound email may show a trimmed text preview elsewhere yet a full quoted thread in the HTML bubble. Flagged as **OQ-2** for the Architect/SpecWriter.

### In scope

- Timeline inbound bubble sanitized-HTML render (FR-1); shared `SafeEmailHtml` + single DOMPurify config (FR-2/3); containment + no cap (FR-4); remote-image blocking + Show-images (FR-5); plain-text linkifier helper (FR-6/7); backend `body_html` on the timeline item + TS type (FR-8/9); workspace refactor to the shared sanitizer (FR-10).

### Out of scope

- Inbound-email **attachments** in the timeline bubble (still workspace-only; EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 kept attachments out of v1).
- Any change to **outbound** rich composition (no HTML compose/WYSIWYG).
- Changes to Gmail OAuth, sync, `users.watch`/Pub/Sub, send/reply, or the `email_*` schema (no migration).
- Persisting the "images shown" choice server-side or per-sender allowlisting (v1 is per-view only).
- Server-side sanitization / a CSP / sandboxed-iframe rearchitecture (DOMPurify remains the app's control; not changing that posture here).
- Quote-collapsing of `body_html` (pending OQ-2).

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1 (FR-1/D1):** At `/pulse/timeline/3044`, an inbound Google LSA email renders with formatting and **clickable** links/buttons; an **outbound** email in the same timeline still renders as plain text.
- **AC-2 (NFR-SEC-1/2/3):** An inbound test email containing `<script>alert(1)</script>`, an `<img onerror=...>`, a `<form>`, and a `javascript:` link renders with all of those neutralized (no alert, no form, no JS link); every rendered `<a>` has `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- **AC-3 (D2/FR-4):** A ~600 px-wide marketing email renders inline with **no** max-height and **no** expand control; it scrolls horizontally **inside its own bubble**; the app layout and chrome are unaffected and un-restyled by the email's `<style>`.
- **AC-4 (D3/FR-5):** On first render, remote images do NOT load (no outbound image request); clicking **"Show images"** loads them.
- **AC-5 (D4/FR-6):** An inbound email with no `body_html` renders as plain text with URLs/emails/phones turned into working `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` links; **no new npm dependency** was added.
- **AC-6 (D5/FR-2/FR-10):** Exactly ONE DOMPurify config exists in the frontend and is used by BOTH `EmailListItem` and `EmailMessageItem`; the `/email` workspace shows no regression on benign mail.
- **AC-7 (D6/FR-8/FR-9):** The timeline API email item includes `body_html`; the `EmailTimelineItem` type carries it; `body_text` is still present and the `body_text ILIKE` search still works; **no DB migration** was introduced.
- **AC-8 (NFR-SEC-5):** Timeline reads remain company-scoped; a cross-tenant fetch attempt returns nothing (isolation preserved).
- **AC-9 (NFR-PERF-1):** Sanitization is memoized per message (not re-run on scroll/re-render); a long timeline with several large HTML emails scrolls without visible jank.
- **AC-10 (NFR-SEC-6):** A forced sanitizer failure falls back to plain-text render; the timeline does not crash.

### Involved modules

- **Frontend (primary):** `frontend/src/components/pulse/EmailListItem.tsx` (main change — inbound HTML render); **new** shared `SafeEmailHtml` helper/component + `linkify` helper (location = Architect's call, e.g. `frontend/src/components/shared/` or `frontend/src/lib/`); `frontend/src/components/email/EmailMessageItem.tsx` (refactor to shared sanitizer, l.87–97); `frontend/src/types/pulse.ts` (`EmailTimelineItem` + `body_html`, ~l.39).
- **Backend (small):** `backend/src/db/emailQueries.js` (add `body_html` to timeline SELECTs ~l.517/548/595; do NOT touch the `body_text ILIKE` at ~l.158); `backend/src/services/email/emailTimelineService.js` (l.70/477/498 mappings); `backend/src/routes/pulse.js` (~l.314 mapping).
- **Reused unchanged:** DOMPurify 3.2.7 (already a dependency); `emailSyncService.js` extractBody (already stores `body_html`); `toTimelineBody`/`emailTimelineBody` (still quote-strips `body_text` only); all EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 send/sync/OAuth paths.

### Affected integrations

- **Gmail / Google (EMAIL-001 / EMAIL-TIMELINE-001):** read-only reuse — `body_html` already synced; no OAuth/sync/schema change.
- **Twilio / Zenbooker / Front / Stripe / VAPI:** none.

### Protected parts (must NOT break)

- The `body_text ILIKE` timeline search (`emailQueries.js` ~l.158) — unchanged.
- `toTimelineBody` quote-stripping of `body_text` — unchanged (`body_html` is passed raw, deliberately).
- EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 send/receive, Gmail `users.watch`/Pub/Sub, OAuth/token refresh, and the `email_*` schema — untouched (no migration).
- Multi-tenant company scoping on all timeline reads — unchanged (NFR-SEC-5, P0).
- `/email` workspace render for benign mail — no regression (NFR-COMPAT-1).
- The app's DOMPurify-as-sanitizer posture (no CSP/helmet/sandboxed-iframe introduced by this feature).

### Open questions routed to the Architect / SpecWriter

- **OQ-1 — Inline `cid:` / `data:` images.** Remote-by-default = blocked is binding (D3). Decide how inline `cid:` (attachment-referenced) and `data:` **image** URIs are handled: allow `data:` images through, resolve/inline `cid:` from stored attachments, or leave both broken in v1 (attachments are otherwise out of scope). `data:` on **links** stays blocked regardless.
- **OQ-2 — HTML quote-collapsing.** `body_text` is quote-stripped (`toTimelineBody`) but `body_html` is rendered raw/full. Decide whether the HTML render should also collapse quoted history/signatures (and if so, client- or server-side), or intentionally show the full thread. Affects EC-8 and the perceived length of the inline (uncapped) bubble.
- **OQ-3 — Sanitizer/containment location & CSS-scoping technique.** Architect to choose where `SafeEmailHtml` lives and the exact containment mechanism (CSS `contain` + scoped wrapper vs. Shadow DOM) that best prevents `<style>`/class leakage while honoring D2 (inline, no cap) and NFR-PERF.

### Notes / lessons applied

- Verify against a **real prod-DB copy** (the 3044 emails) and in a real browser, not only mocked Jest (LIST-PAGINATION-001 / created_by-FK lessons): confirm `body_html` flows onto the timeline item, the LSA email renders with clickable links, malicious samples are neutralized, and remote images stay blocked until opt-in — before any deploy. **Prod deploy is owner-consent-gated (standing rule).**

## EMAIL-QUOTE-STRIP-001 — Strip quoted thread history from inbound HTML emails in the Pulse timeline (timeline-only) (2026-07-06)

**Status:** Requirements (Product/Agent-01). Follow-up to **EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001** (§ above, line 3246) — it **RESOLVES that feature's OQ-2** (line 3369: "whether the HTML render should also collapse quoted history"). Dedup checked: `grep EMAIL-QUOTE-STRIP docs/requirements.md` = none. Frontend-only; **NO backend, NO migration**. Extends the *render* surface only; touches none of EMAIL-TIMELINE-001's OAuth/sync/send/schema paths, and does not re-open EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001's XSS pipeline (the strip runs **after** DOMPurify — D4).

### Problem statement

After EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 shipped (master 62260f4), inbound emails with a `body_html` now render their **full** sanitized HTML in the Pulse timeline bubble (`frontend/src/components/pulse/EmailListItem.tsx`, render-matrix branch **M1** → `SafeEmailHtml`). Real reply threads (e.g. `/pulse/timeline/2599`) carry the **entire quoted conversation history** inside `body_html`: each reply appends an `On … wrote:` attribution line plus a `<blockquote>`/`class="gmail_quote"` subtree containing every prior message. The timeline bubble therefore balloons into a wall of repeated history, burying the one thing the agent needs — the **new** reply — under the whole thread.

This is an **INBOUND-HTML-ONLY** regression of parity that already exists on the other paths:
- **Outbound** timeline bubbles render `body_text` via `linkifyToHtml` (matrix M3), and `body_text` is already quote-stripped server-side by `toTimelineBody` (`backend/src/services/email/emailTimelineBody.js`, `EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 §3c`). Outbound already shows only-new. **Not affected.**
- **Inbound plain-text** (matrix M2) also renders quote-stripped `body_text`. **Not affected.**
- Only **inbound + `body_html`** (M1) renders the raw full thread, because EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 deliberately passes `body_html` **un-quote-stripped** to the sanitizer (its FR-9) and deferred HTML quote-collapsing to OQ-2.

This feature closes that gap for the timeline bubble by stripping the quoted-history subtree from the **inbound HTML** render — restoring the only-new-reply view the old plain-text path always gave. **Ground truth (given, prod-verified):** the 2599 emails mark quotes with `class="gmail_quote"` + `<blockquote>` + an "On … wrote:" attribution; none use `#appendonsend` or `.yahoo_quoted`.

### Binding decisions (from the customer interview — these OVERRIDE any conflicting assumption downstream)

- **D1 — STRIP ENTIRELY (no expander, no collapse).** The quoted-history subtree is **removed** from the rendered DOM. There is **NO** "Show quoted text" / expand / collapse / "…" affordance — the owner explicitly chose full removal. The timeline inbound-HTML bubble shows **only the new reply**. *(unmissable — this is the whole feature)*
- **D2 — TIMELINE-ONLY SCOPE.** Stripping applies **ONLY** to the Pulse timeline bubble (`EmailListItem`, matrix M1). The `/email` **workspace** (`EmailMessageItem`) is the full-thread reader and MUST keep rendering the **complete** quoted history **unchanged**. The strip is therefore **opt-in per call-site** — the shared `SafeEmailHtml` must NOT strip by default. *(unmissable — do not strip in the workspace)*
- **D3 — Detection heuristic (ORDERED; stop at first match).** Locate the quote boundary by, in order: **(1)** `.gmail_quote` (primary for 2599); **(2)** `blockquote[type="cite"]` (Apple Mail); **(3)** Outlook — `#appendonsend`, OR a `<div>` bearing a `border-top` separator that immediately follows a "From:" header block; **(4)** `.yahoo_quoted`; **(5)** the first **top-level** `<blockquote>`; **(6)** text fallback — an attribution line matching `On … wrote:` / `… wrote:`. On the matched boundary, remove that subtree AND the **immediately-preceding attribution line** ("On … wrote:") when one is present. From that boundary onward is discarded.
- **D4 — POST-SANITIZE.** The strip transform runs **AFTER** DOMPurify `sanitizeEmailHtml(...)`, operating on already-sanitized markup/DOM. The XSS pipeline (`frontend/src/lib/sanitizeEmailHtml.ts`) is **untouched** — no config change, no new DOMPurify hook that alters sanitization. Strip removes nodes only; it never re-admits or re-parses attacker HTML back through a less-safe path.
- **D5 — EMPTY-AFTER-STRIP FALLBACK.** If stripping would leave the bubble **empty or near-empty** (the email is essentially all quote — e.g. a bare forward with no new text), render the **FULL (unstripped) sanitized** content instead. **Never show an empty/blank bubble.** *(Mirrors `toTimelineBody`'s "whole body was a quote → fall back, never blank" rule.)* The exact "near-empty" threshold is routed to the Architect (**OQ-QS-1**).
- **D6 — Frontend-only.** No backend change, no new query field, **no migration**. `body_html` already flows to the timeline item (EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 FR-8). The transform is a pure frontend helper.

### User stories / use cases

1. **US-1 (agent, reply thread — the core case).** As an agent viewing `/pulse/timeline/2599`, I see **only the newest inbound reply** in the email bubble — the quoted `On … wrote:` history is gone — so I can read the actual message at a glance instead of scrolling past the whole prior conversation.
2. **US-2 (agent, deep thread).** As an agent on a long back-and-forth (multiple nested quote levels), the bubble strips **everything from the first/outermost quote boundary down**, so nested history never leaks a single level back in.
3. **US-3 (agent, all-quote email).** As an agent opening a bare forward / an inbound email that is essentially all quoted history with no new text, I still see content (the **full** thread) rather than an empty bubble — the strip safely no-ops (D5).
4. **US-4 (agent, no-quote email).** As an agent opening a fresh inbound email that has no quoted history, the bubble renders exactly as EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 already produces it — the strip finds no boundary and changes nothing.
5. **US-5 (agent, `/email` workspace).** As an agent using the full-thread reader at `/email`, I still see the **complete** message including all quoted history — this feature does not touch the workspace (D2).
6. **US-6 (security / whole company).** As the business, quote-stripping never weakens sanitization: the transform runs on already-sanitized DOM (D4), so a malicious inbound email is neutralized by DOMPurify exactly as before, whether or not any quote is stripped.

### Functional requirements

- **FR-1 — Strip quoted history from inbound-HTML timeline bubbles.** In `EmailListItem` matrix **M1** (inbound + `body_html`), the sanitized HTML has its quoted-thread subtree **removed** before/at render, so the bubble shows only the new reply. *(D1)*
- **FR-2 — Entire removal, NO expander.** The stripped subtree is discarded outright — **no** collapse/expand/"Show quoted text" control, no placeholder, no ellipsis marker is rendered in its place. *(D1)*
- **FR-3 — Timeline-only; workspace untouched.** The strip is applied **only** at the `EmailListItem` (timeline) call-site. `EmailMessageItem` (the `/email` workspace) renders `SafeEmailHtml` with the **full** thread and MUST NOT strip. The shared `SafeEmailHtml`/`sanitizeEmailHtml` default behavior is **no strip**; stripping is **opt-in** (e.g. a `stripQuotes` prop on `SafeEmailHtml`, or a separate exported transform the timeline call-site applies — mechanism = Architect, **OQ-QS-2**). *(D2)*
- **FR-4 — Ordered detection heuristic.** Quote-boundary detection follows the D3 order, stopping at the first match: `.gmail_quote` → `blockquote[type="cite"]` → Outlook (`#appendonsend` OR a `border-top`-separated `<div>` after a "From:" block) → `.yahoo_quoted` → first top-level `<blockquote>` → text `On … wrote:` / `… wrote:` attribution. *(D3)*
- **FR-5 — Remove boundary subtree + preceding attribution line.** On a match, remove the boundary element/subtree AND the immediately-preceding attribution line ("On … wrote:") when present. Everything from the boundary to end-of-body is discarded. *(D3)*
- **FR-6 — Strip from the FIRST/outermost boundary.** When multiple or nested quote levels exist, cut at the **earliest/outermost** boundary (highest in the DOM / earliest in document order) so no quoted level survives. *(D3, US-2; parity with `toTimelineBody` "earliest quote-boundary" rule)*
- **FR-7 — Post-sanitize transform.** The strip runs on the output of `sanitizeEmailHtml(...)` (already-sanitized string or its parsed DOM), never on raw `body_html`. It does not modify the DOMPurify config or its hooks. *(D4)*
- **FR-8 — Empty/near-empty fallback → render full.** If, after stripping, the remaining content is empty or below the "near-empty" threshold (OQ-QS-1), render the **full unstripped** sanitized content instead of the stripped result. The bubble is never blank because of stripping. *(D5)*
- **FR-9 — No-boundary passthrough.** If no boundary matches (a fresh email with no quote), the sanitized content is rendered **unchanged** (identical to EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 output). *(D3 fallthrough, US-4)*
- **FR-10 — Attribution-without-blockquote.** A bare attribution line ("On … wrote:") with **no** following quote element still triggers the **text-fallback** boundary (D3 step 6): the attribution line and everything after it are removed. An attribution line with no meaningful text after it collapses into the D5 fallback if that would empty the bubble. *(D3, edge case)*
- **FR-11 — Empty/degenerate quote markers.** Quote markers that are present but **empty** (e.g. an empty `<blockquote>` or a `.gmail_quote` with no content) are removed like any boundary; if their removal changes nothing visible, the render is effectively unchanged (no crash, no empty bubble). *(edge case)*
- **FR-12 — Outbound and plain-text paths untouched.** Matrix **M3** (outbound → `linkifyToHtml(body_text)`) and **M2** (inbound text-only → `linkifyToHtml(body_text)`) are **not** modified; they already show quote-stripped/only-new text. This feature adds nothing to and removes nothing from the text paths. *(scope guard)*

### Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-SEC-1 — XSS pipeline unaffected (PRIMARY).** The strip is **post-sanitize** (D4/FR-7). `sanitizeEmailHtml.ts` (DOMPurify config, `afterSanitizeAttributes` hook, forced `target/rel`, `javascript:`/`data:` blocking, remote-image neutralize, form/script stripping) is **byte-for-behavior unchanged**. No path re-introduces raw email HTML into the DOM. Removing nodes from an already-sanitized tree cannot *add* capability; if the transform ever fails it must **not** fall back to raw (unsanitized) HTML — only to the **full sanitized** content (D5).
- **NFR-SEC-2 — Fail-safe.** If the strip transform throws or cannot parse, it returns the **full sanitized** content (never raw, never empty, never a crash of the timeline) — same defensive posture as `sanitizeEmailHtml` (returns `''`) and `toTimelineBody` (never throws).
- **NFR-CORRECT-1 — Cross-client detection correctness.** Detection must correctly identify the boundary for the verified Gmail shape (2599: `.gmail_quote` + `<blockquote>` + "On … wrote:") and degrade sensibly for Apple Mail / Outlook / Yahoo shapes per the D3 order, **without** false-positive stripping of a legitimate `<blockquote>` a sender used as an actual quotation in the NEW message body. (Trade-off between over- and under-stripping is a detection-tuning concern for the SpecWriter/TestCases; the ordered heuristic + top-level-only `<blockquote>` rule in D3 is the guardrail.)
- **NFR-CORRECT-2 — Signature handled by omission.** The transform removes only the quoted-history subtree (and its attribution line); an author **signature** that sits **outside** that subtree is naturally preserved. This feature does NOT add HTML signature-stripping (mirrors `toTimelineBody`, which keeps the signature). If a signature is embedded *inside* the quoted subtree it goes with the quote (acceptable — it belongs to prior messages).
- **NFR-PERF-1 — No perf regression.** The strip runs **once per message**, folded into the existing per-message sanitize memo in `SafeEmailHtml` (memo key `(messageId ?? hash(html), allowImages)`), NOT on every scroll/re-render. It must not add a second full HTML parse when it can operate on the DOM the shadow render already builds (mechanism = Architect). A long timeline with several large HTML threads must not visibly jank (inherits EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 NFR-PERF-1).
- **NFR-COMPAT-1 — Workspace backwards-compat.** `/email` (`EmailMessageItem`) render output is **identical** to today for every email (D2/FR-3). No visual or behavioral change in the full-thread reader.
- **NFR-COMPAT-2 — Idempotent transform.** Applying the strip twice yields the same result as applying it once (stripping already-stripped content is a no-op). Important because the sanitize memo may re-run on `allowImages` toggle.
- **NFR-COMPAT-3 — No new dependency.** Detection/removal uses the DOM already available in the shadow render (or a lightweight parse of the sanitized string) and standard selectors/regex — **no new npm package**.

### Edge cases (explicitly in scope to handle)

- **EC-1 — No quote boundary found.** Render the full sanitized content unchanged (FR-9). Identical to EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 today.
- **EC-2 — Multiple / nested quote levels.** Strip from the FIRST/outermost boundary; no inner level survives (FR-6).
- **EC-3 — Email is ALL quote (bare forward / no new text).** D5 fallback: render the FULL unstripped sanitized content; never an empty bubble (FR-8).
- **EC-4 — Attribution line with NO following blockquote.** Text-fallback boundary still fires; attribution + trailing content removed (FR-10); collapses to D5 if that empties the bubble.
- **EC-5 — Quote markers present but empty.** Removed like any boundary; no crash, no empty bubble (FR-11).
- **EC-6 — Legitimate `<blockquote>` in the NEW message.** Risk of over-stripping a quotation the sender wrote in their new reply. Ordered heuristic prefers client-specific markers (`.gmail_quote`, `blockquote[type="cite"]`, `.yahoo_quoted`) before the generic "first top-level `<blockquote>`"; tuning/verification is a SpecWriter/TestCases concern (NFR-CORRECT-1). Flagged **OQ-QS-3**.
- **EC-7 — Interaction with "Show images" (FR-5 of parent).** After stripping, remote images that lived **inside** the quoted history are gone. The timeline's `REMOTE_IMG_RE.test(email.body_html)` gate (`EmailListItem` l.56) currently probes the **raw** `body_html`, so the **"Show images"** button could appear yet reveal nothing (all remote images were in the stripped quote). The "Show images" control itself is **unaffected** in mechanics, but the probe SHOULD be evaluated against the **stripped** HTML so the button reflects what's actually visible. Routed **OQ-QS-4**.
- **EC-8 — Outbound / plain-text.** Untouched (FR-12); already only-new via `toTimelineBody`.
- **EC-9 — `allowImages` toggle re-render.** When the agent clicks "Show images", `SafeEmailHtml` re-sanitizes with `allowImages:true`; the strip must re-apply deterministically and idempotently so the reply stays stripped and images inside the *kept* reply reveal (NFR-COMPAT-2).

### In scope

- Post-sanitize quote-strip transform for the **inbound-HTML timeline bubble** (`EmailListItem` M1): ordered detection (FR-4), boundary+attribution removal (FR-5), first/outermost cut (FR-6), empty→full fallback (FR-8), no-boundary passthrough (FR-9), text-fallback attribution (FR-10), empty-marker handling (FR-11); opt-in wiring so the **workspace stays full** (FR-3); memoized/idempotent/no-new-dep implementation (NFRs).

### Out of scope

- Any **expander / collapse / "Show quoted text"** UI (explicitly rejected — D1).
- Stripping quotes in the **`/email` workspace** (`EmailMessageItem`) — it keeps the full thread (D2).
- Changing the **outbound** or **inbound-plain-text** render paths (already quote-stripped via `toTimelineBody`).
- HTML **signature** stripping (only *quoted history* is removed; signature outside the quote is kept — NFR-CORRECT-2).
- Any **DOMPurify / sanitizer** config change (D4); any CSP/iframe rearchitecture.
- Any **backend / query / migration** change (`body_html` already surfaced by EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 FR-8; D6).
- Server-side quote-collapsing of `body_html` (this is a client render transform).
- Persisting a per-email/per-sender "show full thread" preference.

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1 (D1/FR-1/FR-2):** At `/pulse/timeline/2599`, an inbound reply that carried an `On … wrote:` + `.gmail_quote`/`<blockquote>` history renders showing **only the new reply**; the quoted history is **absent** and there is **no** expand/"Show quoted text" control anywhere in the bubble.
- **AC-2 (D2/FR-3/NFR-COMPAT-1):** Opening the **same** message in the `/email` workspace still shows the **full** quoted thread, unchanged from before this feature.
- **AC-3 (D3/FR-4/FR-5):** For a Gmail-shaped email, both the `.gmail_quote`/`<blockquote>` subtree **and** the immediately-preceding "On … wrote:" attribution line are removed; nothing from the boundary downward remains.
- **AC-4 (FR-6/EC-2):** A 3-deep nested reply thread strips at the outermost boundary — zero quoted levels remain in the bubble.
- **AC-5 (D5/FR-8/EC-3):** A bare-forward / all-quote inbound email renders the **FULL** sanitized content (not blank); the bubble is never empty due to stripping.
- **AC-6 (FR-9/EC-1):** A fresh inbound HTML email with no quote renders **byte-identically** to EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 output (transform is a no-op).
- **AC-7 (FR-10/EC-4):** An inbound email with an "On … wrote:" line but no `<blockquote>` after it has that line (and trailing content) removed; if that empties the body, the full content is shown (D5).
- **AC-8 (D4/FR-7/NFR-SEC-1):** `frontend/src/lib/sanitizeEmailHtml.ts` is unchanged; the malicious-sample test from EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 (AC-2 there: `<script>`, `onerror`, `<form>`, `javascript:` link) still passes with quote-stripping active — no XSS regression, and a forced strip-transform failure falls back to **full sanitized** (never raw) content.
- **AC-9 (NFR-PERF-1):** Stripping is memoized per message (folded into the existing sanitize memo), not re-run on scroll; a long timeline with several large HTML threads scrolls without visible jank.
- **AC-10 (NFR-COMPAT-2/EC-9):** Clicking "Show images" on a stripped inbound HTML bubble keeps the reply stripped (idempotent) and reveals only images within the kept reply.
- **AC-11 (FR-12/EC-8):** Outbound and inbound-plain-text bubbles are unchanged (still only-new via `body_text`).
- **AC-12 (NFR-COMPAT-3):** No new npm dependency was added.

### Involved modules

- **Frontend (only):**
  - `frontend/src/components/pulse/EmailListItem.tsx` — the **timeline** call-site (matrix M1, l.107–137). Opt into stripping here (e.g. pass `stripQuotes` to `SafeEmailHtml`, or apply an exported transform). Also the `showImagesButton` probe on raw `body_html` (l.56) is the EC-7 touch-point (OQ-QS-4).
  - `frontend/src/components/email/SafeEmailHtml.tsx` and/or `frontend/src/lib/sanitizeEmailHtml.ts` — where the **post-sanitize** strip is invoked. If added to `SafeEmailHtml`, it MUST be **opt-in** and default-off so the workspace is unaffected; the sanitize **memo** (l.106–112) is the natural home for the once-per-message strip. A **new** pure helper (e.g. `frontend/src/lib/stripEmailQuote.ts`) is the likely home for the detection/removal logic (Architect's call).
  - `frontend/src/components/email/EmailMessageItem.tsx` — the **workspace** reader (l.110–112). **MUST NOT** strip (D2); assert it stays on the non-stripping path.
- **Reused unchanged:** DOMPurify config (`sanitizeEmailHtml.ts` core), `linkifyToHtml`, `toTimelineBody` (the plain-text stripper it mirrors), all EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 / EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 backend and OAuth/sync/send paths. **No backend file changes. No migration.**

### Affected integrations

- **Gmail / Google / Twilio / Zenbooker / Front / Stripe / VAPI:** **none.** Pure frontend render transform on already-synced `body_html`.

### Protected parts (must NOT break)

- **XSS pipeline** — `frontend/src/lib/sanitizeEmailHtml.ts` DOMPurify config + hook, forced link `target/rel`, `javascript:`/`data:` blocking, remote-image neutralize, form/script stripping — **unchanged** (D4/NFR-SEC-1). Strip is strictly post-sanitize.
- **`/email` workspace full-thread render** (`EmailMessageItem`) — must keep showing complete quoted history (D2/NFR-COMPAT-1).
- **Outbound + inbound-plain-text** timeline render (matrix M2/M3) and **`toTimelineBody`** server-side quote-strip of `body_text` — untouched (FR-12).
- **"Show images" gate** mechanics (EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 FR-5) — control still works; only its *probe target* may move to the stripped HTML (EC-7/OQ-QS-4).
- **Per-message sanitize memo / no-jank perf** (EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 NFR-PERF-1) — must not regress (NFR-PERF-1).
- **Multi-tenant company scoping** on timeline reads — unchanged (frontend-only, no query change).
- **No new dependency; no migration; no backend change** (D6/NFR-COMPAT-3).

### Open questions routed to the Architect / SpecWriter

- **OQ-QS-1 — "Near-empty" threshold for D5.** Define the precise cutoff at which a post-strip bubble is "empty or near-empty" and must fall back to the full render. Candidates: zero rendered text after trim; visible text length below **N** chars (mirror `toTimelineBody`'s spirit — it treats a fully-stripped body as empty and falls back); or "no element with non-whitespace text content remains." Architect to fix N / the rule.
- **OQ-QS-2 — Strip mechanism & seam.** Decide: a `stripQuotes?: boolean` prop on `SafeEmailHtml` that runs the transform inside the sanitize memo, VS. a standalone exported helper (`stripEmailQuote(sanitizedHtml)` or `(shadowRoot)`) that only the `EmailListItem` call-site invokes. Either MUST keep the workspace on the non-stripping path and run once-per-message (perf). String-level (re-parse sanitized HTML) vs. DOM-level (operate on the shadow subtree the render already builds) — pick for correctness + no double-parse.
- **OQ-QS-3 — Over-strip guard for a genuine top-level `<blockquote>`.** How aggressively to treat the generic "first top-level `<blockquote>`" (D3 step 5) when a sender legitimately quoted text in their **new** message. Confirm the ordered heuristic (client-specific markers first) is sufficient, or add a guard (e.g. only cut a top-level `<blockquote>` when preceded by an attribution line, or when it is the trailing block).
- **OQ-QS-4 — "Show images" probe vs. stripped HTML.** The `showImagesButton` gate (`EmailListItem` l.56) tests **raw** `body_html`; after stripping, remote images may only exist in the removed quote, so the button could show but reveal nothing. Decide whether to re-point the probe at the **stripped** HTML (recommended) so the affordance matches what's visible.
- **OQ-QS-5 — Outlook `border-top`-after-"From:" detection precision.** The D3 Outlook heuristic (a `<div>` with a `border-top` separator following a "From:" block) is the least deterministic branch. Since 2599 is Gmail (no `appendonsend`/Outlook), confirm how much Outlook precision v1 must guarantee vs. defer, and how to detect the separator on the **sanitized** DOM (inline `style` border vs. class).

### Notes / lessons applied

- Verify against the **real prod-DB copy** (the **2599** thread) and in a **real browser**, not only mocked Jest (LIST-PAGINATION-001 / created_by-FK lessons): confirm the timeline bubble shows only the new reply, the `/email` workspace still shows the full thread, the all-quote fallback renders full (never blank), and the malicious-sample sanitizer test still passes with stripping active — before any deploy. **Prod deploy is owner-consent-gated (standing rule).**
- Mirrors the **precedent** already in the codebase: `toTimelineBody` (`emailTimelineBody.js`) cuts at the **earliest** quote boundary, **keeps the signature**, and **falls back rather than blanking** when the whole body is a quote — this HTML strip is the DOM analogue of that plain-text behavior, aligning M1 with M2/M3.
## CONTACT-MERGE-001: объединение контактов с подтверждением — confirm-диалог merge/transfer при добавлении чужого телефона/почты

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-07-06 · **Owner:** Contacts / Pulse / Timeline
**Type:** feature — frontend (новый confirm-диалог «Merge contacts» + подключение обоих v1-редакторов) + backend (конфликт-детекция в `PATCH /api/contacts/:id`, телефонная ветка резолюции, расширение `contactEmailMergeService.mergeContacts` на звонки/SMS, transfer-примитив). Запрос владельца + clarified decisions 1–4 (интервью Step 0.5) — **binding**.

### Duplication check (result)

Не дубликат — это осознанная **замена тихой ветки** CONTACT-EMAIL-MERGE-001 на подтверждаемую + закрытие двух реальных дыр:

- **CONTACT-EMAIL-MERGE-001 (прод с 2026-07-05)** уже умеет полный мердж (`contactEmailMergeService.mergeContacts` — FK-порядок load-bearing: open tasks re-home ДО удаления таймлайна, dup-контакт удаляется ПОСЛЕДНИМ) и диспатч `resolveAddedEmail` (inbox-only link / D2a full-merge / D2b re-point). Но D2a/D2b выполняются **тихо, без вопроса** — контакт может быть удалён или его переписка перецеплена без ведома пользователя. Эта фича ставит между «адрес принадлежит другому контакту» и «действие» confirm-диалог.
- **Скалярная дыра (реальный прод-инцидент):** `resolveAddedEmail` срабатывает ТОЛЬКО когда PATCH шлёт массив `emails[]` (шлёт только `EditContactDialog`). Инлайн-редактор почты в Pulse-панели (`frontend/src/components/contacts/PulseContactPanel.tsx:82`) шлёт `PATCH {email}` — скаляр, БЕЗ `emails[]` → мердж не срабатывает вообще. Владелец попал ровно в это (пара контактов 4175/4228 починена вручную в прод-БД 2026-07-06). Фича обязана закрыть эту дыру.
- **Телефонная сторона не покрыта никем:** `timelineMergeService.mergeOrphanTimelines` обрабатывает только ОРФАННЫЕ таймлайны (`contact_id IS NULL`); случай «номер принадлежит ДРУГОМУ контакту» сегодня не обрабатывается никак — тихо появляются два контакта с одним номером, звонки/SMS маршрутизируются по `updated_at`-эвристикам. Эта фича добавляет телефонную ветку в тот же confirm-флоу.
- Общего UI «merge two arbitrary contacts» по-прежнему нет и в v1 не появляется — мердж достижим только через добавление конфликтующего атрибута (как и было заявлено в Out-of-scope CONTACT-EMAIL-MERGE-001; `mergeContacts` строился reusable ровно под такое будущее).

### Description

Когда пользователь при редактировании контакта добавляет **телефон или почту, уже принадлежащие другому контакту той же компании**, система не выполняет тихих действий, а показывает **confirm-диалог с двумя колонками** — «Контакт 1» (редактируемый) и «Контакт 2» (владелец конфликтующего атрибута): имя + все телефоны + все почты каждого, конфликтующий атрибут визуально выделен. Пользователю предлагаются варианты:

- **(а) Объединить контакты полностью.** Survivor = редактируемый контакт; его скалярные поля (имя, компания, заметки) побеждают; телефоны/почты второго доезжают в secondary/additional; лиды/джобы/эстимейты/инвойсы/платежи/задачи переезжают на survivor; **таймлайны объединяются** (звонки, SMS, письма, задачи — всё на таймлайн survivor); дубль удаляется. Zenbooker НЕ блокирует: сохраняется `zenbooker_customer_id` редактируемого контакта, ZB-привязка дубля отбрасывается (без вызовов ZB API).
- **(б) Оставить оба контакта и перенести атрибут.** Телефон/почта **снимается с Контакта 2 и добавляется Контакту 1** (перенос, не копия), и вместе с ним переезжает **тред этой контактной информации**: для телефона — звонки+SMS с цифрами ЭТОГО номера (второй номер владельца и его история остаются на месте), для почты — `email_messages` этого адреса. Контакт 2 живёт дальше со всей остальной идентичностью.
- **Отмена** — ничего не сохраняется (весь Save атомарно отменён, см. FR-7).

**Правило «единственного атрибута»:** если после переноса Контакт 2 остался бы **без единого телефона и без единой почты**, вариант (б) не предлагается — только полное объединение (нельзя оставить контакт «пустым»). Диалог всё равно показывается (с одной кнопкой merge) — тихого удаления больше нет даже для email-only авто-контактов (замена D2a).

Тихая привязка «ничейных» inbox-писем (адрес не принадлежит никакому контакту — ветка D3/inbox-only) **остаётся тихой** — там спрашивать не о чем. Поверхность v1 — только пользовательские редакторы контакта, бьющие в `PATCH /api/contacts/:id` (`EditContactDialog` + инлайн-почта Pulse-панели); фоновые пути (создание лида, Mail Secretary, VAPI, email-ingestion, `mergeOrphanTimelines` для орфанов) не трогаются.

### Взаимодействие с CONTACT-EMAIL-MERGE-001 (что заменяется / что остаётся)

**Заменяется (только add-time ветки с чужим владельцем):**
- Тихий **D2a** (owner email-only → авто-full-merge + delete) → диалог с единственной опцией «Объединить» (правило единственного атрибута). Никакой контакт больше не удаляется без явного подтверждения.
- Тихий **D2b** (owner с идентичностью → авто-re-point писем) → диалог с выбором merge/transfer. Изменение семантики transfer vs D2b: адрес теперь **снимается с владельца** (`contact_emails`-строка + синхронизация скаляра `contacts.email`, если это был primary), а не просто перецепляются сообщения — единоличное владение адресом.

**Остаётся без изменений:**
- **Inbox-only тихая привязка** (D3, `linkInboxMessages` / ничейные `email_messages`) — как была.
- **`mergeContacts(survivorId, dupId, companyId, client)`** — переиспользуется как ядро варианта (а); FK-рецепт B3 (tasks → timelines → contact, dup последним, NOT-EXISTS-гарды на M2M) — неизменен и обязателен. Расширяется (не ломается) переносом звонков/SMS и телефонных полей — см. FR-4.
- **Tx-семантика Decision A** (sync, внутри PATCH, одна транзакция contact+emails+resolution) и **идемпотентность** end-to-end.
- **Company-scoping** каждой ноги, `isContactEmailOnly`/`IDENTITY_TABLES` (переиспользуются в определении «пустоты», где применимо), `enrichEmail`-upsert, `linkMessageToContact`, `email_by_contact` CTE (лист не меняется).
- Триггер по-прежнему НЕ срабатывает, если адрес уже принадлежит самому редактируемому контакту (идемпотентный re-save = no-op, без диалога).

### User scenarios

1. **Конфликт почты → диалог → полный мердж.** Диспетчер в `EditContactDialog` добавляет контакту «Jane Smith» адрес `x@acme.com`, который принадлежит контакту «X Acme» (у того есть и телефон, и лид). Save прерывается диалогом: две колонки (Jane: её телефоны/почты · X Acme: его телефоны/почты, `x@acme.com` выделен), кнопки «Объединить контакты» / «Перенести почту» / Отмена. Диспетчер выбирает «Объединить»: поля Jane побеждают, телефоны/почты X Acme доезжают в secondary/additional, его лид/задачи переезжают, таймлайны сливаются (звонки+SMS+письма X Acme теперь в таймлайне Jane), `zenbooker_customer_id` Jane сохранён, ZB-привязка дубля отброшена, X Acme удалён. Pulse-лист показывает одну объединённую беседу.
2. **Конфликт телефона → диалог → transfer треда.** Диспетчер добавляет контакту «Acme Billing» secondary-номер `+1617…22`, который является primary-номером контакта «Bob» (у Bob есть второй номер и джоба). В диалоге выбирает «Перенести телефон»: номер снят с Bob и записан Acme Billing; звонки и SMS **с цифрами именно этого номера** перецеплены на таймлайн Acme Billing; Bob жив, его второй номер, джоба и остальная история звонков нетронуты. Будущие звонки/SMS с этого номера резолвятся в Acme Billing.
3. **У второго контакта только этот атрибут → только merge.** Добавляемый адрес принадлежит email-only авто-контакту (одна почта, ни телефона, ничего больше — ровно то, что раньше тихо съедал D2a). Диалог показывает обе колонки, но единственное действие — «Объединить контакты» (transfer скрыт с пояснением: контакт нельзя оставить без телефона и почты). Подтверждение → полный мердж + удаление дубля. То же для контакта с единственным телефоном и без почты при попытке забрать этот телефон.
4. **Отмена — ничего не сохранилось.** Пользователь видит диалог и жмёт Отмена/Escape. **Весь PATCH отменён атомарно**: ни конфликтующий атрибут, ни остальные правки этого Save не записаны; редактор остаётся открытым с введёнными значениями — пользователь может убрать конфликтующий атрибут и пересохранить (тогда Save проходит без диалога). Продуктовая фиксация: никаких «частичных» сохранений — предсказуемость важнее удобства.
5. **Pulse-панель попадает в тот же флоу (закрытие скалярной дыры).** Диспетчер вписывает почту в инлайн-редактор Pulse-панели (`PulseContactPanel`). Путь обязан (i) персистить адрес в `contact_emails` (а не только скаляр) и (ii) при конфликте показывать тот же диалог с теми же исходами. Кейс 4175/4228 больше невоспроизводим ни из какого v1-редактора.
6. **Конфликтов несколько (телефон + почта, разные владельцы).** Один Save добавил телефон, принадлежащий контакту A, и почту, принадлежащую контакту B. Конфликты разрешаются **последовательно, по диалогу на каждого владельца-контакта**; каждый резолвится независимо (merge/transfer/отмена); отмена любого — отмена всего Save (FR-7). Несколько конфликтующих атрибутов ОДНОГО владельца показываются в одном диалоге.

### Functional requirements

- **FR-1. Конфликт-детекция (server-side, company-scoped).** `PATCH /api/contacts/:id` при добавлении телефона (`phone_e164`/`secondary_phone`, сравнение по нормализованным цифрам/E.164) или почты (`emails[]` ИЛИ скаляр `email` — обе формы) определяет, принадлежит ли атрибут ДРУГОМУ контакту той же `company_id` (телефон — по `contacts.phone_e164/secondary_phone`; почта — `findEmailContact`-семантика: `contacts.email OR contact_emails.email_normalized`). Конфликт есть → Save НЕ применяется, клиенту возвращается конфликтный ответ (напр. 409) с данными обеих сторон для диалога (id/имя/все телефоны/все почты каждого + флаг «transfer допустим»). Механизм (409-раунд-трип vs pre-check endpoint) — решение архитектора; требование: детекция и финальная валидация — на сервере, **race-safe** (повторная проверка внутри commit-транзакции: владелец мог измениться между показом диалога и подтверждением → если резолюция более неприменима, вернуть свежий конфликт, не выполнять устаревшее действие).
- **FR-2. Confirm-диалог.** Две колонки: Контакт 1 (редактируемый) / Контакт 2 (владелец) — имя + все телефоны + все почты, конфликтующий атрибут выделен; действия: «Объединить контакты», «Перенести телефон/почту» (когда допустим), Отмена. Это подтверждение (не entity-редактор) — класс поверхности confirmation-dialog по канону (на мобиле — BottomSheet по OVERLAY-CANON-002); токены Blanc, без хардкода цветов. Тексты действий литеральные, с 1-строчным пояснением последствий каждого варианта (мердж = «второй контакт будет удалён, вся история переедет»; transfer = «номер/почта и его переписка переедут, контакт останется»).
- **FR-3. Правило единственного атрибута.** Вариант «Перенести» предлагается ТОЛЬКО если после переноса у Контакта 2 остаётся ≥1 телефон или почта. Иначе — только «Объединить» (+ Отмена) с пояснением. Оценка — server-side (флаг в конфликтном ответе), клиент лишь отражает.
- **FR-4. Полный мердж (вариант а).** Ядро — существующий `contactEmailMergeService.mergeContacts` (survivor = редактируемый контакт), **расширенный** для телефонного мира: (i) re-point звонков (`calls.timeline_id`/`contact_id`) и SMS-привязок dup-таймлайна на таймлайн survivor ДО удаления dup-таймлайна; (ii) телефоны dup доезжают в свободные слоты survivor (`phone_e164`→`secondary_phone`, т.к. слотов два; переполнение — см. OQ-2), почты dup — в `contact_emails` (additional, NOT-EXISTS-гард уже есть); (iii) скаляры survivor (имя, компания, заметки) побеждают; (iv) `zenbooker_customer_id` survivor сохраняется, ZB-привязка dup отбрасывается, никаких вызовов ZB API. FK-рецепт B3 неизменен: open tasks re-home до удаления таймлайна; dup-контакт удаляется последним. Всё внутри той же PATCH-транзакции (Decision A).
- **FR-5. Transfer телефона (вариант б).** Номер снимается с Контакта 2 (обнуление соответствующего поля `phone_e164`/`secondary_phone`; если снят primary при живом secondary — promotion secondary→primary — решение архитектора зафиксировать) и записывается Контакту 1; на таймлайн Контакта 1 перецепляются ТОЛЬКО звонки и SMS, чьи цифры соответствуют ЭТОМУ номеру (второй номер владельца и его тред остаются). Таймлайн Контакта 1 — через `findOrCreateTimelineByContact` (re-home shadow-orphan open tasks включён). Будущая маршрутизация inbound-звонков/SMS этого номера — на Контакт 1.
- **FR-6. Transfer почты (вариант б).** Адрес удаляется из `contact_emails` Контакта 2 (+ синхронизация его скаляра `contacts.email`, если это был primary) и добавляется Контакту 1 (`enrichEmail`-семантика); `email_messages` этого адреса перецепляются на таймлайн Контакта 1 (`linkMessageToContact`, идемпотентно). Остальная почта/история Контакта 2 нетронута.
- **FR-7. Отмена = полный откат Save.** Пока пользователь не подтвердил резолюцию, НИ ОДНО изменение этого Save не персистится (включая неконфликтующие поля). Отмена в любом из последовательных диалогов (сценарий 6) отменяет весь Save. Редактор сохраняет введённое состояние.
- **FR-8. Обе v1-поверхности проходят через флоу.** `EditContactDialog` и инлайн-почта `PulseContactPanel` (скалярный `PATCH {email}` — привести к `emails[]` или эквивалентной обработке на сервере) обязаны: писать `contact_emails`, получать конфликт, показывать диалог, слать подтверждённую резолюцию. Детекция в самом PATCH ⇒ любой будущий пользовательский клиент этого роута получает защиту автоматически.
- **FR-9. Тихие ветки сохраняются.** Inbox-only привязка ничейных писем (D3) — тихо, как сейчас. `mergeOrphanTimelines` для орфанных телефонных таймлайнов — тихо, как сейчас (орфан — ничей, спрашивать не о чем). Фоновые пути (lead-создание, Mail Secretary, VAPI, email-ingestion) диалог НЕ получают и поведение НЕ меняют.
- **FR-10. Идемпотентность и tenancy.** Повторное подтверждение той же резолюции (двойной клик, ретрай) — no-op без дублей/ошибок. Все ноги — резолюция, re-point, delete — фильтрованы `company_id` из `req.companyFilter?.company_id`; адрес/номер, существующий в другой компании, невидим и неприкасаем; чужой contact id → 404 (security-канон).

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** Добавление почты, принадлежащей другому контакту компании, из `EditContactDialog` НЕ выполняет тихий мердж/re-point: Save прерывается, диалог показывает обе стороны (имя + все телефоны + все почты), выделяет конфликтующий адрес.
- **AC-2.** Выбор «Объединить»: survivor = редактируемый; его имя/компания/заметки нетронуты; телефоны/почты дубля в secondary/additional; лиды/джобы/эстимейты/инвойсы/платежи/задачи переехали; звонки+SMS+письма дубля видны в таймлайне survivor; открытые задачи дубля живы (не съедены CASCADE); `zenbooker_customer_id` survivor прежний; дубль удалён; `findEmailContact`/телефонный резолв возвращают survivor.
- **AC-3.** Выбор «Перенести» для телефона: номер исчез у владельца, появился у редактируемого; звонки/SMS с цифрами ЭТОГО номера — на таймлайне редактируемого; второй номер владельца и его звонки/SMS — на месте; владелец не удалён.
- **AC-4.** Выбор «Перенести» для почты: адрес исчез из `contact_emails` владельца (скаляр синхронизирован), появился у редактируемого; `email_messages` адреса — на таймлайне редактируемого; прочая почта владельца нетронута; владелец не удалён.
- **AC-5.** Владелец, у которого после переноса не осталось бы ни телефона, ни почты, получает диалог ТОЛЬКО с опцией «Объединить»; тихого авто-мерджа (бывший D2a) не происходит ни в одном случае.
- **AC-6.** Отмена: в БД не изменилось НИЧЕГО (контакт, `contact_emails`, таймлайны, звонки, письма, задачи — байт-в-байт); редактор сохранил ввод; повторный Save без конфликтующего атрибута проходит без диалога.
- **AC-7.** Ввод конфликтующей почты через Pulse-панель даёт тот же диалог и те же исходы; скалярный `PATCH {email}` больше не создаёт молчаливый дубль (регресс кейса 4175/4228).
- **AC-8.** Тихие ветки не регрессировали: ничейные inbox-письма привязываются тихо; `mergeOrphanTimelines` для орфанов работает байт-в-байт; фоновые ingestion-пути не показывают диалогов и не меняют поведения.
- **AC-9.** Tenancy: двух-компанийная фикстура — одинаковый адрес/номер в другой компании не детектится, не показывается в диалоге, не переносится, не удаляется.
- **AC-10.** Идемпотентность/race: повторная отправка подтверждённой резолюции — no-op; резолюция, ставшая неприменимой (владелец изменился), отклонена с новым конфликтом, устаревшее действие не выполнено. Реальный прогон против prod-копии БД (LIST-PAGINATION-001 lesson) для всех веток: merge, transfer-phone, transfer-email, only-attribute, cancel, cross-tenant.

### Constraints / non-functional

- **Никаких тихих деструктивных действий с существующим контактом** — любой delete/re-point чужого контакта только через подтверждение. Erring toward «спросить» безопасен; erring toward «сделать тихо» — нет.
- **Одна транзакция** (Decision A наследуется): contact-update + emails/phones upsert + подтверждённая резолюция — атомарно внутри PATCH; сбой не оставляет полу-мердж или удалённый контакт с осиротевшими детьми. Async-ноги (leads-cascade, ZB contact push) — снаружи tx, как сейчас.
- **FK-дисциплина** (ORPHAN-TASK-REHOME-001 / рецепт B3): open tasks re-home ДО удаления таймлайна (`tasks.thread_id` = `ON DELETE CASCADE` — ловушка); dup-контакт удаляется ПОСЛЕДНИМ; M2M — с NOT-EXISTS-гардами.
- **Company-scoping обязателен на каждой ноге** (прецеденты LIST-PAGINATION-001 SMS-leak, ZB-ISO-001); `company_id` только из `req.companyFilter?.company_id`.
- **Перенос телефона = перенос только звонков/SMS с цифрами ЭТОГО номера** — не всей телефонной истории владельца.
- **Без миграций, если возможно** — модель (`contacts`, `contact_emails` mig 025, `calls.timeline_id/contact_id`, `email_messages` mig 079/129, индекс mig 143) покрывает нужды; новая миграция — только под требуемый индекс телефонного лукапа (PULSE-PERF-001: EXPLAIN на prod-копии, никаких спекулятивных индексов; уже есть expression-индексы по цифрам телефона из мигр 149). Номер миграции — перепроверить max непосредственно перед созданием (параллельные ветки).
- **Mocked jest недостаточно** — реальный прогон merge/transfer против prod-копии до деплоя (LIST-PAGINATION-001 lesson).
- **Диалог — подтверждение, не редактор**: без полей ввода, без частичного выбора атрибутов в v1 (никакого «чекбокс-пикера» что переносить — ровно два действия владельца).
- Деплой в прод — только с явного согласия владельца (standing rule).

### Открытые вопросы (для архитектора/владельца)

- **OQ-1 (архитектор):** механизм конфликт-раунда — `409 + resolution`-параметр повторного PATCH vs отдельный pre-check endpoint; фиксированное требование — server-side детекция + race-safe повторная проверка в tx.
- **OQ-2 (владелец, есть безопасный дефолт):** переполнение телефонных слотов при полном мердже (у обоих контактов по 2 номера; слотов у survivor два, таблицы `contact_phones` нет). **Дефолт:** номера дубля занимают свободные слоты; не поместившиеся номера на survivor не сохраняются (их звонки/SMS всё равно переезжают на таймлайн — история не теряется), факт фиксируется в заметке/логе. Альтернатива (новая M2M-таблица телефонов) — вне v1.
- **OQ-3 (архитектор):** при снятии primary-номера у владельца в transfer — промоутить ли его secondary в primary (рекомендация: да, чтобы `phone_e164` не пустовал при живом secondary).

### Involved modules

- **Backend:** `backend/src/routes/contacts.js` (`PATCH /:id` — конфликт-детекция обеих форм (скаляр/массив), конфликтный ответ, приём резолюции, tx); `backend/src/services/contactEmailMergeService.js` (расширение: телефонная резолюция, re-point звонков/SMS в `mergeContacts`, transfer-примитивы phone/email, флаг «transfer допустим»); `backend/src/db/emailQueries.js`, `backend/src/db/timelinesQueries.js` (`findOrCreateTimelineByContact`, re-point звонков — reuse); телефонный lookup по цифрам (reuse expression-индексов мигр 149).
- **Frontend:** новый диалог подтверждения merge/transfer (компонент уровня `frontend/src/components/contacts/`); `EditContactDialog.tsx` (перехват конфликта → диалог → повторный Save с резолюцией); `PulseContactPanel.tsx` (перевод инлайн-почты на `emails[]`/конфликтный флоу); `frontend/src/services/contactsApi.ts` (типы конфликтного ответа + резолюции).
- **Tests:** jest на все ветки резолюции (merge/transfer/only-attribute/cancel/идемпотентность/tenancy/race) + документированный real-DB-copy прогон.

### Integrations

- **Zenbooker** — БЕЗ вызовов API: `zenbooker_customer_id` survivor сохраняется, привязка дубля отбрасывается при удалении; существующий async ZB contact-push на PATCH не меняется. **Twilio** — не трогается (маршрутизация inbound выигрывает косвенно: исчезают дубли номеров). **Front / Stripe / Google** — нет.

### Protected parts (must not break)

- `server.js`, `authedFetch`, `useRealtimeEvents` — не трогать.
- **Фоновые ingestion-потоки** — email-ingestion (`linkInboundMessage` / Gmail push), Mail Secretary, VAPI, создание лида: поведение байт-в-байт, никаких диалогов/блокировок в них.
- **`timelineMergeService.mergeOrphanTimelines`** и его async-триггер в PATCH — орфанная (ничейная) ветка остаётся тихой и нетронутой.
- **Inbox-only тихая привязка** (D3-ветка `resolveAddedEmail`/`linkInboxMessages`) — остаётся тихой.
- **`contactEmailMergeService.mergeContacts`** — FK-рецепт B3 (порядок tasks → timelines → contact, NOT-EXISTS-гарды) сохраняется; расширение аддитивно.
- **`email_by_contact` CTE / `getUnifiedTimelinePage`** (EMAIL-OUTBOUND-001, LIST-PAGINATION-001, PULSE-PERF-001) — форма/семантика/план запроса без изменений.
- **`linkMessageToContact`** (идемпотентный re-link + EMAIL-UNREAD-001), `findEmailContact`, инварианты `contact_emails` (mig 025), expression-индексы мигр 143/149.
- Leads-cascade и async ZB contact sync в `PATCH /:id` — продолжают срабатывать.
- Tenancy-гарантии (ONBOARD-FIX-001 / ZB-ISO-001) и канон authenticate + requireCompanyAccess.

### Out of scope

- Общий UI «выбрать два произвольных контакта и объединить» (merge достижим только через конфликт при добавлении атрибута); частичный/полевой merge-редактор (чекбоксы «что перенести»).
- Конфликт-диалог в фоновых путях (lead-создание, Mail Secretary, VAPI, ingestion) и в mobile-app.
- Undo/история мерджей, восстановление удалённого дубля; M2M-таблица телефонов (OQ-2 альтернатива).
- Изменение unread-модели, ZB push при мердже, unified-list запроса.

## MOBILE-TECH-APP-002: Tech-workflow parity for the native iOS technician app (Finance-on-job / Tasks / Search)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-07-06 · **Owner:** Mobile / Field-tech
**Type:** feature — **mobile app only** (`albusto-mobile`, RN/Expo, separate repo — v1 M00–M11 complete on its `master` @ `59b8860`). Brings the app to parity with what a field technician (role `provider`) already does in the mobile web CRM: (A) estimates & invoices **on the job card** (view/create/edit/send, Price Book line-item picker), (B) a **Tasks** tab (own tasks: view/complete/create), (C) **search** (instant local over the jobs cache + server-side jobs & contacts). **All required backend routes and provider permissions already exist in prod** — this feature is expected to need **NO backend code change and NO migration** (next free = 156, none anticipated; the Architect confirms). Parent/continuity: `docs/specs/MOBILE-TECH-APP-001-SPEC.md` + `albusto-mobile/STATUS.md` ("What's NEXT" item 2, scope chosen with the owner 2026-07-03).

**Binding owner decisions (interview done — these OVERRIDE any conflicting assumption):**
- **D1 — Offline policy for ALL new areas = ONLINE-ONLY.** Finance, Tasks, and server search fetch over the network when opened; with no connectivity they render a polite "needs connection" placeholder. The existing jobs SQLite cache, `GET /api/sync/jobs` delta contract, and SyncEngine are **untouched** — estimates/invoices/tasks never enter the cache or the sync delta. (Consistent with the v1 locked decision "offline = READ-ONLY, no offline write queue".)
- **D2 — Finance lives ONLY in JobDetail.** An "Estimates & Invoices" section on the job card lists the documents linked to that job, with create/edit/send. **NO** company-wide document list tabs/screens in the app.
- **D3 — Line-item editor = Price Book picker + freeform, parity with the web editor.** Category → Group → Item navigation; picking a **Group** bulk-adds its member items as lines (PRICEBOOK-001 semantics, `GET /api/price-book/groups/:id/expand`); freeform lines remain available. Picker is **read-only** (provider has `price_book.view` only — mig 141).
- **D4 — Search = two tiers.** (a) **Instant local** search over the SQLite jobs cache (client name / address / service / city) on the Schedule tab — works offline; (b) **server** search: jobs via `GET /api/jobs?search=` (provider-scoped server-side; finds jobs outside the 30-day cache window) and contacts via `GET /api/contacts?search=` (name/phone → call). Server tier is online-only.
- **D5 — Payments / collecting money = OUT OF SCOPE.** Tap-to-Pay is v1.5 (M12), a locked owner decision. No record-payment, no card capture, no payment UI in this feature.
- **D6 — Tasks = a third tab.** The server scopes the list itself: a provider (has `tasks.view` + `tasks.create`, **no** `tasks.manage`) is auto-scoped to **own** tasks via `scopeOwnerId` in `GET /api/tasks`. The provider can: see own open tasks, complete them, and create a task. The client never filters for security.

### Duplication check (result)

**Not a duplicate — this is the planned "phase 2" of MOBILE-TECH-APP-001** (the parity scope pre-agreed with the owner in `albusto-mobile/STATUS.md`). It is a **mobile client** over features already shipped in the web CRM by: **JOBS-UX-RBAC-001** (mig 138 — provider full self-serve finance perms), **PRICEBOOK-001/002** (catalog + routes + `price_book.view` for provider, mig 141), **TASKS-001** + **AR-TASK-UNIFY-001** (tasks model, routes, `scopeOwnerId` scoping, mig 136/139), **INVOICE-EDIT-ITEMS-001** (`PUT /api/invoices/:id` transactional item replace), **SEND-DOC-001** (send estimate/invoice by email(PDF+link)/SMS + public pages). None of those change; the app consumes them. The prod audit (orchestrator, 2026-07-05) confirmed the mobile API contract is unbroken: `sync.js`/`devices.js`/`jobs.js`/`keycloakAuth.js` unchanged since the Phase-0 deploy; migrations 152–155 are mail-agent only.

### 1. Problem

The v1 app (M00–M11) covers the read path + status/notes/photos, but a field technician still has to open the mobile *web* CRM for three everyday actions: writing an estimate/invoice on site (the app only shows a read-only `invoice_total` line), seeing and closing the tasks assigned to them, and finding a job or customer that isn't on today's agenda (no search at all; the cache only holds a 30-day window). That breaks the "one app in the field" promise and keeps the web tab alive.

### 2. Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**
- A provider can **create, edit, and send an estimate or invoice from the job card**, including Price-Book-driven line items — full parity with the provider's web capability.
- A provider can **see their own open tasks, complete them, and create a task** from a dedicated Tasks tab (and create in-context from a job).
- A provider can **find any job** (instant local + server-wide) and **find a contact by name/phone to call** — including entities outside the 30-day cache window.
- Zero backend change; zero migration; zero disturbance to the v1 offline sync core.

**Non-goals (out of scope)**
- Payments of any kind (Tap-to-Pay = v1.5/M12; `record-payment` and `payments.collect_offline` flows excluded).
- Company-wide estimate/invoice list screens; editing the Price Book from the app (`price_book.manage` not granted to provider).
- Offline caching / offline queueing of finance, tasks, or server-search results; any change to the SQLite schema or `GET /api/sync/jobs`.
- Full CRM surfaces (Pulse / Contacts CRUD / Leads / Telephony / Settings) — out of the tech workflow (STATUS.md scope).
- Task management of OTHER users' tasks (no `tasks.manage`); task delete UI.
- Android; anything requiring a new backend permission or route.

### 3. User stories (actor = field technician, role `provider`)

1. **Estimate on site.** Finishing a diagnostic visit, the tech opens the job card → "Estimates & Invoices" → creates an estimate, adds "Refrigerator compressor" items from the Price Book picker (one Group tap adds the whole set of lines), adjusts a price, adds a freeform "expedited part" line, saves, and sends it to the customer — before leaving the driveway.
2. **Invoice after completion.** After completing the job, the tech converts/creates an invoice on the same card, checks the items, and sends it (email/SMS). Payment collection is not offered (out of scope).
3. **My tasks.** In the morning the tech opens the Tasks tab and sees only THEIR open tasks ("pick up the part at the supplier", "call Mrs. Chen before arrival"), sorted by due date with overdue on top; each shows its parent entity; completing one is one tap.
4. **Task in context.** On a job card the tech creates a task "order drain pump, model DW80" attached to that job; it later shows up on the Tasks tab and (for the office) in the web CRM.
5. **Find an old job.** A customer calls about a visit from two months ago (outside the cache window). The tech types the name into search: local cache results appear instantly; a "server" section then returns the old job; opening it fetches the job detail online.
6. **Find a number to call.** The tech remembers only the customer's street; contact search by name/street fragment surfaces the contact and a Call action (`tel:`, native dialer — MOBILE-NO-SOFTPHONE-001).
7. **Offline politeness.** In a basement with no signal, the Finance section, Tasks tab, and server search each show a friendly "This needs a connection" state (no spinners forever, no crashes); the Schedule/JobDetail cached read path keeps working as in v1.

### 4. Functional requirements

#### 4.1 Finance on the job card (FR-FIN)

- **FR-FIN-1 — "Estimates & Invoices" section in JobDetail (online-only).** On opening a job card with connectivity, fetch the job's documents via `GET /api/estimates?job_id={id}` and `GET /api/invoices?job_id={id}` (both filters verified in `backend/src/routes/estimates.js:35` / `invoices.js:35`). Render as one section: document number, type, status, total (invoices additionally balance due). Empty → a "Create estimate / Create invoice" affordance only (no "—" rows). Offline → "needs connection" placeholder. The existing cached `invoice_total` line is superseded by this section.
- **FR-FIN-2 — Document detail view.** Tapping a document opens it (`GET /api/estimates/:id` / `GET /api/invoices/:id`): status, dates, line items (name/qty/price/amount), totals; invoices also amount paid / balance due (read-only — payments data via existing response shape; `payments.view` is granted).
- **FR-FIN-3 — Create from the job.** "Create estimate" → `POST /api/estimates` with `job_id`; "Create invoice" → `POST /api/invoices` with `job_id` (perm gates `estimates.create` / `invoices.create` — provider has them, mig 138). The new document opens in the editor (FR-FIN-5).
- **FR-FIN-4 — Edit.** Editing saves via `PUT /api/estimates/:id` / `PUT /api/invoices/:id` with the full items array, matching the web contract. **Invoice item semantics are the INVOICE-EDIT-ITEMS-001 contract:** `items` array present ⇒ transactional replace; `[]` ⇒ clear; `undefined` ⇒ leave untouched — the app MUST always send the explicit array when items were edited.
- **FR-FIN-5 — Line-item editor: Price Book picker + freeform (parity with web).** Reads: `GET /api/price-book/categories`, `/groups?category_id=`, `/items` (search/filter), and `GET /api/price-book/groups/:id/expand` for **Group → bulk line add** (all gated `price_book.view` — provider has it, mig 141). Picking an Item adds one line (name/price prefilled, qty editable); picking a Group adds all its member items as lines. A freeform line (name, qty, unit price) is always available. No Price Book mutation from the app.
- **FR-FIN-6 — Send.** "Send" on a document calls `POST /api/estimates/:id/send` / `POST /api/invoices/:id/send` (perm `estimates.send` / `invoices.send` — provider has them), with the channel options the web offers (SEND-DOC-001: email with PDF+public link / SMS). The Architect pins the exact request payload and which channel choices surface on mobile.
- **FR-FIN-7 — No payment actions.** No record-payment, no Tap-to-Pay, no payment links initiated as a payment-collection flow (D5). The invoice's balance/status is display-only.

#### 4.2 Tasks tab (FR-TSK)

- **FR-TSK-1 — Third tab "Tasks" (online-only).** List = `GET /api/tasks` (`backend/src/routes/tasks.js`; filters available: `status|parent_type|overdue|due_from|due_to|limit|offset`). The server auto-scopes a non-`tasks.manage` user to their OWN tasks via `scopeOwnerId` — the app sends **no** owner filter and never widens/narrows scope client-side. Default view: open tasks, overdue surfaced first, grouped/sorted by due date; pagination via `limit/offset`.
- **FR-TSK-2 — Complete.** One-tap complete = `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` (status → completed). Optimistic UI is allowed but must reconcile with the server response; failure (offline/4xx) reverts with a message.
- **FR-TSK-3 — Create.** `POST /api/tasks` (perm `tasks.create` — provider has it): from the Tasks tab and in-context from JobDetail (parent = the current job: `job_id`). Minimum fields: title (required), due date (optional), parent (required when created from a job; from the tab the Architect pins the parent-selection UX — proposed default: created-from-tab tasks require picking one of the tech's jobs, since the app has no lead/contact/document pickers).
- **FR-TSK-4 — Parent context on a task.** Each task row shows its parent type + label (parents possible: job/lead/contact/estimate/invoice — mig 136). Tapping a task whose parent is a **job** opens JobDetail (from cache when present, else online `GET /api/jobs/:id`). Non-job parents render as **info-only** (no navigation) in this feature — see OQ-M2-1.
- **FR-TSK-5 — Tab badge (nice-to-have).** Open-task count via `GET /api/tasks/count` on the tab icon; refreshed on tab focus/foreground. Failure to load the count is silent (no badge).
- **FR-TSK-6 — No offline persistence.** Tasks are not stored in SQLite and not added to the sync delta; offline → tab placeholder (D1).

#### 4.3 Search (FR-SRCH)

- **FR-SRCH-1 — Instant local search (works offline).** A search entry on the Schedule tab filters the SQLite jobs cache as-you-type across customer name, address, city, service name. Results are cached jobs → open JobDetail as today. No network required.
- **FR-SRCH-2 — Server jobs search (online-only).** The same query (debounced) also hits `GET /api/jobs?search=` (`backend/src/routes/jobs.js:156`; provider-scoped server-side via `getProviderScope` — returns only the tech's assigned jobs, including ones **outside** the 30-day cache window). Server results render in a separate "More results" section, deduped against local hits; opening one fetches `GET /api/jobs/:id` online (it is NOT inserted into the sync cache — D1).
- **FR-SRCH-3 — Contacts search → call (online-only).** Contact lookup via `GET /api/contacts?search=` (`backend/src/routes/contacts.js:84`; provider-scoped server-side) by name/phone fragment; a result shows name + phone(s) with a **Call** action (`tel:` native dialer — softphone stays desktop-only). No contact editing/creation.
- **FR-SRCH-4 — Offline behavior.** With no connectivity the local tier still works; the server sections show the "needs connection" state instead of results (never an error toast storm).

### 5. Non-functional requirements

- **Online-only semantics (D1):** every new network surface distinguishes three states — loading, loaded, needs-connection — using the app's existing connectivity/`ApiError` handling; no infinite spinners; a Retry affordance on the placeholder. Writes (save/send/complete/create) are blocked with a clear message when offline (v1 rule: every write needs network).
- **Security = server-side scoping only:** the app relies on the backend gates (`getProviderScope` on jobs/contacts, `scopeOwnerId` on tasks, permission middleware on finance/price-book routes) and MUST NOT implement any client-side "verified/role" logic; a 403 renders as a polite unavailable-state. No new permissions are introduced or assumed.
- **API conventions:** all calls go through the existing client (`getJson/postJson/postForm/del` + `ApiError` mapping backend `{code,message}`); Bearer token refresh behavior unchanged (M01/M03).
- **Performance:** local search results render < 100 ms on a 300-job cache; server search debounce ≥ 300 ms; JobDetail finance fetch does not block the cached (instant) part of the card — the section loads independently.
- **Quality gates:** app `jest` suite extended (currently 44/44 — keep green + cover: finance list/editor payload building incl. the `items` array semantics, Price Book group-expand → lines mapping, tasks list/complete/create flows, search merge/dedup logic, offline placeholders) and `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo prebuild` still applies cleanly.
- **UI:** follows the app's existing v1 design language (STATUS.md/M04-M05 screens); product name in UI = **Albusto** only.

### 6. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1:** On a job with linked documents, JobDetail shows the Estimates & Invoices section with correct numbers/statuses/totals from `?job_id=` fetches; on a job with none, only the create affordances appear; offline shows the needs-connection placeholder while the rest of the cached card renders normally.
- **AC-2:** A provider creates an estimate on a job, adds lines via Price Book (single Item AND whole Group bulk-add) plus one freeform line, saves, reopens — items persist exactly; the same document is visible/identical in the web CRM.
- **AC-3:** Editing an invoice's items from the app transactionally replaces them (INVOICE-EDIT-ITEMS-001): edited list ⇒ replaced; emptied list ⇒ cleared; opening-and-saving without touching items ⇒ items untouched (no `items` key sent or `undefined`).
- **AC-4:** Send works from the app for both document types via the existing send routes, and the sent artifacts (email PDF+link / SMS) match what the web send produces for the same document.
- **AC-5:** No payment-collection UI exists anywhere in the app (code search + screen audit); invoice balance is display-only.
- **AC-6:** The Tasks tab of a provider WITHOUT `tasks.manage` shows only that user's tasks (verified against a seeded second user's tasks being absent) — with the app sending no owner filter; complete and create round-trip to the server and appear in the web CRM.
- **AC-7:** A task created from JobDetail carries `job_id` = that job; tapping a job-parent task opens that job; non-job-parent tasks render info-only without crashing.
- **AC-8:** Local search filters the cache instantly (and works in airplane mode); server search returns an assigned job older than the 30-day window that local search cannot find; opening it renders JobDetail online and does NOT alter the SQLite cache contents or the sync cursor.
- **AC-9:** Contacts search by partial name and by phone fragment returns provider-visible contacts with a working `tel:` Call action; another company's / unassigned contacts never appear (server-scoping regression check).
- **AC-10:** The v1 core is regression-free: `GET /api/sync/jobs` delta application, schedule rendering, status FSM, notes/photos — existing jest suites stay green and no SQLite schema migration occurs in the app.
- **AC-11:** Zero backend diffs and zero new DB migrations ship with this feature (backend repo untouched; if the Architect finds a genuine backend gap, it returns to Product as a scope change, not a silent addition).

### 7. Constraints & dependencies

**Backend routes reused AS-IS (verified in code 2026-07-05/06 — ground truth, do not re-derive):**
- `backend/src/routes/estimates.js` — `GET /` (supports `job_id`, `search`, `include_archived`), `POST /`, `GET /:id`, `PUT /:id`, `POST /:id/send`, item subroutes; gates `estimates.view/create/send`.
- `backend/src/routes/invoices.js` — `GET /` (supports `job_id`, `estimate_id`), `POST /`, `GET /:id`, `PUT /:id` (transactional items replace, `Array.isArray` guard), `POST /:id/send`; gates `invoices.view/create/send`. (`/:id/record-payment` gated `payments.collect_offline` — NOT used, D5.)
- `backend/src/routes/price-book.js` — `GET /categories`, `GET /groups`, `GET /groups/:id/expand`, `GET /items` (`price_book.view`); writes `price_book.manage` (not used).
- `backend/src/routes/tasks.js` — `GET /` (auto `scopeOwnerId` for non-manage), `GET /count`, `GET /entity/:parentType/:parentId`, `POST /` (`tasks.create`), `PATCH /:id`; parents job/lead/contact/estimate/invoice (mig 136).
- `backend/src/routes/jobs.js` — `GET /?search=` + `GET /:id`, provider-scoped via `getProviderScope`.
- `backend/src/routes/contacts.js` — `GET /?search=`, provider-scoped via `getProviderScope`.
- **Provider permission baseline (already in prod):** mig 050 (`jobs.view`, `jobs.done_pending_approval`, `schedule.view`, `phone_calls.use`, …) + mig 138 (`estimates.view/create/send`, `invoices.view/create/send`, `payments.view`) + mig 141 (`price_book.view`) + TASKS-001 (`tasks.view`, `tasks.create`).

**Mobile-side constraints:** RN/Expo app in the separate `albusto-mobile` repo (no git remote — local + Mac-mini build rig, see STATUS.md); existing API client + `ApiError` conventions; existing tab navigator grows Schedule | Tasks | Settings; iOS only; testing = jest + tsc (no e2e harness — the human post-login smoke from STATUS.md "NEXT #1" extends to these flows).

**Integrations affected:** **none directly.** Zenbooker/Twilio/Front/Gmail are untouched — sending documents rides the existing backend send pipeline (SEND-DOC-001), and calls use the native dialer. Zenbooker remains master for payments (not touched — no payment surface, D5).

**Protected parts (must not break):**
- **The v1 offline sync core:** `GET /api/sync/jobs` contract (`backend/src/routes/sync.js:88` — and per D1 it will NOT grow estimates/invoices/tasks), the app's SyncEngine/applyDelta, the SQLite `jobs` cache schema, the `(updated_at,id)` cursor semantics.
- **Backend mobile contract:** `sync.js`, `devices.js`, `jobs.js` status routes, `keycloakAuth.js` — unchanged (prod audit baseline).
- **Server scoping/permission gates:** `getProviderScope`, `scopeOwnerId` behavior, all `requirePermission` gates listed above — consumed, never modified or worked around.
- **Web CRM finance/tasks editors** and the PRICEBOOK/SEND-DOC/INVOICE-EDIT-ITEMS behavior — the app is a new consumer only.
- **v1 app flows:** M01 auth/Keychain, M02 cache isolation (owner marker), M07 status FSM, M08 notes/photos, M11 push.
- Locked decisions: no payments (v1.5), desktop-only softphone, offline READ-ONLY.

**Verification note (house lesson — LIST-PAGINATION-001 / created_by-FK):** before any release, exercise the finance create→edit→send and tasks list/complete paths against a **real backend with a prod-DB copy** under a REAL provider account (jest mocks the DB and hides RBAC/FK truths); confirm the tasks list of a non-manage provider excludes others' tasks on real rows. Prod deploy — none required for backend; the app build/TestFlight step remains owner-gated per standing rules.

### 8. Open questions

- **OQ-M2-1 — Non-job task parents (lead/contact/estimate/invoice): navigation target?** Proposed default (binding until overridden): render parent type + label **info-only**, no navigation (the app has no screens for those entities). Alternative = deep-link to the mobile web CRM. → Architect/owner.
- **OQ-M2-2 — Send channels on mobile:** expose both email and SMS send options as the web does, or a simplified single "Send" using the web defaults? Architect pins the payload of `POST /:id/send` and the mobile UX. Proposed: parity (both), matching SEND-DOC-001.
- **OQ-M2-3 — Task creation from the Tasks tab (no parent context):** proposed = require picking one of the tech's own jobs as parent (only picker the app can build cheaply). Confirm, or allow contact-parent via contacts search. → Architect.
- **OQ-M2-4 — Archived estimates on the job card:** default = exclude (`include_archived` omitted), matching the web card. Confirm. → Architect.

### 9. Involved modules (summary)

- **New (all in `albusto-mobile`):** JobDetail "Estimates & Invoices" section + document detail screen + document editor (items + Price Book picker) + send sheet; Tasks tab (list/complete/create) + in-job task create; search UI on Schedule (local filter + server sections) + contact result row with Call; shared "needs connection" placeholder component; API modules for estimates/invoices/price-book/tasks/jobs-search/contacts-search over the existing client.
- **Modified (app):** tab navigator (third tab), JobDetail (section replaces the `invoice_total` line), Schedule header (search entry).
- **Backend:** **no changes** (routes/permissions consumed as-is; migration count stays at 155).

## CALLFLOW-BUSY-TO-AGENT-001: business-hours queue exhaustion routes to the AI agent (Sara), voicemail becomes the LAST resort

### 1. Problem

When an inbound call reaches the «Dispatch Team» queue node during business hours and no dispatcher takes it, the caller hits the voicemail announcement ("Hello! Our team is currently assisting other customers…") — three ways: (a) NO dispatcher available at all (everyone offline in presence OR busy on a call → `availableAgentsForGroup` returns `[]` → instant fallback), (b) dispatchers ring but nobody answers before the Dial timeout (`DialCallStatus=no-answer` → `queue.timeout`), (c) the dial fails outright (`busy|failed|canceled` → `queue.failed`). The company already has a live voice assistant (VAPI Sara, assistant `30e85a87`) answering the after-hours branch of the same flow. During business hours a missed caller should get Sara — who can qualify, book and answer — instead of a recorder. Voicemail should only be heard when Sara herself is unreachable.

### 2. Owner decisions (binding)

1. **All three failure cases** (no-agents instant / ring-timeout / dial-fail) route through the **one existing queue fallback edge → Sara**. Prefer **DATA-ONLY** (no runtime code change).
2. **Fallback chain:** Dispatchers → Sara; Sara fails/unconfigured (`vapi.no_target vapi.failed vapi.timeout`) → **business-hours voicemail** (`sk-vm-business-hours`) — voicemail stays the LAST resort, reached only after trying Sara.
3. **After-hours branch untouched** (hours-check → existing `n-1780888101885` 'AI Greeting' → `sk-vm-after-hours` on failure — as today).
4. Change the **current active prod flow** (`call_flows.id='cf-bbd3689d'`, company `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`, group `ug-2385d69d`) as **editor-format data via an idempotent script**; the graph must stay fully loadable/editable in the flow-editor UI. Prod flow-data update is owner-consented.
5. `answerOnBridge="true"` is already emitted by `renderVapiNode` — keep, no change (memory: otherwise Sara's greeting clips).
6. Verify that **no seeding/reset path** (`ensureFlowForGroup` and friends) can later overwrite/regenerate the customized graph; if any can, the design must neutralize it.

### 3. Functional requirements

- **FR-1 (no-agents instant → Sara):** business hours, `availableAgentsForGroup` → `[]` → the queue node's failure routing lands on a `vapi_agent` node and the caller is SIP-dialed to Sara **in the same webhook response** (no announcement, no voicemail).
- **FR-2 (ring-timeout → Sara):** dispatchers ring, Dial times out (`queue.timeout`) → the dial-action response TwiML dials Sara on the still-live caller leg.
- **FR-3 (dial-fail → Sara):** `queue.failed` / `queue.not_answered` → same edge → Sara.
- **FR-4 (Sara-fail → business VM):** from the new business-hours vapi node, `vapi.no_target|vapi.failed|vapi.timeout` → `sk-vm-business-hours` (business-hours greeting `VM_GREETING`, NOT the after-hours one). `vapi.completed` still ends the call (runtime interception, `callFlowRuntime.advance`).
- **FR-5 (untouched paths):** `queue.connected`/`call.handoff` success path, the whole after-hours subtree, voicemail→final completion edges, and every other tenant's flow behave byte-identically to today.
- **FR-6 (idempotent script, data-only):** a script applies the graph delta to exactly the one prod row; pure transform function (unit-testable), dry-run diff mode, no-op on re-run, **refuses** (no write) when the expected graph shape is not found. No migration, no deploy, no restart — `ensureFlowForGroup` re-reads `call_flows` per inbound call.

### 4. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1:** Simulated no-agents call renders vapi `<Dial>…<Sip>` TwiML with `answerOnBridge="true"` and `?vapiNode=1` dial-action directly from the queue node's failure routing.
- **AC-2:** `advance(callSid,'queue.timeout')` and `…'queue.failed'` / `…'queue.not_answered'` at the queue node return the vapi node's TwiML (returned as the dial-action HTTP response — verified against `handleDialAction`).
- **AC-3:** `advance` at the new vapi node with `vapi.failed`/`vapi.timeout` (and `renderVapiNode` with unresolvable SIP) returns voicemail TwiML with the **business-hours** greeting; `vapi.completed` returns `<Hangup>` and never reaches voicemail.
- **AC-4:** after-hours flow: `isBusinessHours=false` still routes hours-check → `n-1780888101885`; its failure still lands on `sk-vm-after-hours`. Transform leaves the after-hours subtree byte-identical.
- **AC-5:** script run twice → second run exits 0 with NOOP and identical `graph_json`; script against a mutated/unexpected graph → exits non-zero, writes nothing (sabotage control proves the guard is non-vacuous).
- **AC-6:** transformed graph loads in the flow editor (no dangling transitions, all kinds in `ENABLED_KINDS`, `validateGraph`-clean) and survives an editor save round-trip (delta uses only `reactFlowToGraph`-serialized fields).
- **AC-7:** only `call_flows` row `cf-bbd3689d` of company `…0001` changes; all other rows (other tenants, other groups) byte-identical before/after.
- **AC-8 (code freeze):** `backend/src/services/callFlowRuntime.js`, `groupRouting.js`, `webhooks/twilioWebhooks.js`, `routes/callFlows.js` are NOT modified — runtime-change verdict is «none needed» (see architecture).

### 5. Constraints & protected parts

- Zenbooker/payments untouched. VAPI live assistant untouched (no PATCH — the flow only dials its SIP URI resolved from `vapi_tenant_resources` / env `VAPI_SIP_URI`).
- Protected: `answerOnBridge="true"` on both queue and vapi Dials; `vapi.completed` → end-call interception; voicemail greeting selection by `config.branchKey`; `TELEPHONY-AUTONOMOUS-MODE-001` (forces after-hours branch — feature simply not in its path).
- Prod apply is a **data change**, not a deploy: no docker build, no Keycloak logout (no SPA chunks change). Owner-consented per standing rule.


## SCHEDULE-MOBILE-MAP-001: Map view for the mobile Schedule day

### 1. Problem

On the **mobile** Schedule the day view is a stacked list of jobs (`DayView` mobile branch) for
the selected day + selected technician filter (mobile forces `viewMode=day` — `useScheduleData`
~l.81). A field tech / dispatcher on a phone has no spatial view of the day: they cannot see how
the day's stops lay out geographically or in what order they run. Jobs already carry `lat`/`lng`
from SCHED-ROUTE-001, and the desktop slot-picker (`CustomTimeModal`) already renders numbered,
per-technician-colored pins with a proven Google-Maps setup — but that map is trapped inside the
slot picker and is desktop-oriented.

### 2. Owner decisions (binding)

1. **Toggle = ONE icon-button next to the mobile Schedule FILTER (gear) button.** In list mode it
   shows a **Map** icon (tap → map); in map mode it shows a **List** icon (tap → back to list). A
   single button whose icon swaps by mode — NOT two buttons. The map is **full-screen** (replaces
   the list area) for the same jobs, not an overlay.
2. The map shows **exactly the jobs the list currently shows**: the selected day + the selected
   technician filter. **No "only if one tech" gate** — any number of techs plot together.
3. **Un-geocoded jobs** (`geocoding_status !== 'success'` or null `lat`/`lng`) are **NOT plotted**;
   a small note shows their count ("N job(s) without a location").
4. **Pin numbering = route order per tech**; draw simple **straight connector lines** (`Polyline`)
   between a tech's consecutive stops in stop order. **NO paid Directions API** (no road-following).
5. **Frontend-only.** NO backend, NO migration (jobs already carry `lat`/`lng`). **Desktop Schedule
   untouched. Mobile-only.** Reuse the desktop map's pin/color rendering.

### 3. Functional requirements

- **FR-1 (toggle button):** on mobile Schedule a single icon-button renders adjacent to (left of)
  the gear/filter button; icon = Map when list is shown, List when map is shown; tap flips the day
  area between `DayView` list and the map. Desktop shows neither the button nor the map.
- **FR-2 (same jobs):** the map plots the SAME item set the mobile list renders — `scheduledItems`
  (already provider/tag-filtered, day-scoped on mobile). No separate fetch/query.
- **FR-3 (per-tech numbered pins):** each plotted job is a pin colored by its assigned technician
  (`getProviderColor(techId).accent`, matching the tiles' left-border color) and numbered by its
  1-based position in that tech's `start_at`-ordered stops. Jobs with no tech → an "Unassigned"
  group (neutral color), numbered among themselves.
- **FR-4 (no-geo excluded + counted):** jobs without a successful geocode are omitted from the map;
  a small note shows the count of such listed jobs. No client-side geocoding fallback.
- **FR-5 (connectors):** for each tech with ≥2 plotted stops, one straight `Polyline` through the
  stops in order, in the tech color. No cross-tech lines; 1-stop tech → no line; no Directions API.
- **FR-6 (pin InfoWindow):** tapping a pin opens an InfoWindow with tech name + number, time
  (company tz), job title/customer, and address.
- **FR-7 (reactivity):** changing the provider filter or the selected day updates the map in place
  (re-plots + re-fits) while staying in map mode.
- **FR-8 (empty/back):** an empty day → empty map + message; tapping the List icon returns to the
  list with the map cleanly unmounted (no marker/listener leaks).
- **FR-9 (reuse without breakage):** the pin SVG (`makePinSvg`) is extracted to a shared util used
  by BOTH the new mobile map and `CustomTimeModal`; the slot-picker map keeps its exact current
  behavior (numbered pins, green "new job" star, geocode-on-miss, InfoWindow, legend).

### 4. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1:** `npm run build` (tsc -b, strict `noUnusedLocals`) passes; shared `mapPins.ts` is
  imported by both consumers with no unused exports.
- **AC-2:** On mobile, one swap-icon button sits left of the gear; Map icon in list mode, List icon
  in map mode; tapping toggles the day area between list and full-width map (verified in preview).
- **AC-3:** In map mode the plotted pins == the geocoded subset of the listed jobs; per-tech color
  matches the tile left-border color; numbering is per-tech in start-time order.
- **AC-4:** Jobs with `geocoding_status !== 'success'`/null coords are not plotted and the
  "N without a location" note shows N = (listed − plotted).
- **AC-5:** A tech with ≥2 stops shows a straight in-order polyline in its color; no Directions/road
  geometry; two techs → two separate lines.
- **AC-6:** Tapping a pin opens the InfoWindow; changing provider or day re-plots in place; tapping
  List returns to the list with no console errors and no duplicate pins on re-entry.
- **AC-7 (freeze):** desktop Schedule renders no toggle/map; `CustomTimeModal` slot-picker map is
  visually and behaviorally unchanged (pins, star, geocode-on-miss, legend). No backend file and no
  migration changed.

### 5. Constraints & protected parts

- Frontend only; no `/api/*` change, no migration, `backend/**` untouched.
- Reuse `loadGoogleMaps()`, `getProviderColor()`, and the extracted `makePinSvg()`; do not add a
  second Google-Maps loader or a second per-tech color scheme on this page.
- Protected: `CustomTimeModal` (live VAPI-SLOT-ENGINE slot picker) — only edit is swapping its inline
  `makePinSvg` for the shared import (byte-identical output). Desktop Schedule views untouched.
- Google Maps via the existing `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`; missing key → graceful inline message.

## SLOT-ENGINE-NEAREST-FALLBACK-001 — Tier-2 nearest-tech distance fallback

**Status:** Requirements
**Priority:** P1
**Owner:** Slot Engine / Voice
**Spec:** `Docs/specs/SLOT-ENGINE-NEAREST-FALLBACK-001.md`
**Test cases:** `Docs/test-cases/SLOT-ENGINE-NEAREST-FALLBACK-001.md`
**Depends on:** SLOT-ENGINE-001, REC-SETTINGS-001, VAPI-SLOT-ENGINE-001

### 1. Description

A caller who is inside the service area but has no technician within the normal radius currently
gets ZERO engine recommendations, so Sara falls back to generic `checkAvailability` slots. Add a
**Tier-2 "nearest-tech fallback"** to the slot engine: when Tier-1 (normal radius) yields no feasible
candidate, relax the distance gate to the nearest technician(s) up to a **separate 25 mi ceiling** and
return real engine-ranked windows. Verified root cause: the resolved distance gate is 10 mi on both
the busy-day and empty-day paths (`buildConfigOverride` maps one `max_distance_miles` onto both);
raising only the fallback ceiling makes e.g. Weston MA 02493 return 2–3 real slots.

### 2. Functional requirements

- **FR-1 (Tier-1 unchanged):** For any currently-covered location, output is byte-identical to today
  (same recs, scores, order, no new fields). Tier-1 runs first, untouched.
- **FR-2 (Tier-2 trigger):** Tier-2 fires **only** when Tier-1 produces zero feasible candidates.
- **FR-3 (Tier-2 gate):** Tier-2 relaxes the distance ceilings (busy-day + empty-day) to
  `geography.fallback_max_distance_miles` (default **25**); a candidate beyond 25 mi is still rejected.
- **FR-4 (nearest):** "nearest" = min(distance to tech base, distance to that tech's nearest existing
  job that day); Tier-2 recs are ranked nearest-first (existing distance-weighted score).
- **FR-5 (non-overlap):** `overlap.max_timeframe_overlap_minutes=0` is preserved in Tier-2 — no
  returned window overlaps an existing job; feasibility (drive time within the 2-hour window) still
  enforced.
- **FR-6 (empty-day):** A nearest tech with an empty day is eligible in Tier-2, driving from base.
- **FR-7 (shape):** Same slot shape + `top_n` (2–3). Tier-2 recs additively carry `fallback_tier=2`
  and reason `nearest_tech_fallback`; `summary.used_nearest_fallback` reflects whether Tier-2 ran.
- **FR-8 (off-switch):** `fallback_max_distance_miles ≤ normal radius` (or 0/null) disables Tier-2 →
  exact legacy behavior.
- **FR-9 (CRM passthrough):** `buildConfigOverride` emits `fallback_max_distance_miles=25` on every
  request (fixed constant, no per-company setting).

### 3. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1:** Weston-style request (in-area, all techs ≥11.8 mi) returns ≥1 rec with `fallback_tier=2`
  and `used_nearest_fallback=true`; a ~40 mi request returns `[]`.
- **AC-2:** The entire existing `slot-engine` suite (`engine.test.js`, `scenarios.test.js`,
  `explain.test.js`) passes unchanged; a snapshot of `baseRequest()` recs is deep-equal to baseline.
- **AC-3:** No Tier-2 rec overlaps an existing job; a physically-infeasible window is still rejected.
- **AC-4:** `buildConfigOverride(DEFAULTS).geography.fallback_max_distance_miles === 25`.
- **AC-5:** No migration, no new company setting, no Sara/VAPI change, no `recommendSlots.js` logic
  change.

### 4. Constraints & protected parts

- **Tier-1 is frozen** — implemented by running the current candidate loop verbatim in Pass 1; the
  loop body is extracted to a helper but not modified.
- `deriveFallbackConfig` operates on a config **clone** — never mutates the request config (protects
  the Tier-1 pass and `rankAndDiversify`).
- Fixed engine config for the 25 mi cap (no `slot_engine_settings` column, no Settings UI).
- Do not touch Sara's VAPI assistant/prompt; `recommendSlots.js` unchanged.

## PWA-FIX-001: an installed Albusto PWA (app.albusto.com) on iOS stays in its standalone window during navigation (stop ejecting into SFSafariViewController)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-07-07 · **Owner:** Frontend / PWA
**Type:** bug-fix + hardening — **frontend only** (`frontend/`, Vite + React SPA). **NO backend, NO migration** (migration count stays at 155). One run covers all four areas: (A) Web App Manifest, (B) Apple/PWA `<head>` meta, (C) brand icons, (D) auth "no-eject" hardening. Continuity/ground truth: verified diagnosis below (do NOT re-derive) + owner binding decisions.

### Verified diagnosis (ground truth — confirmed in code 2026-07-07, do not re-derive)

1. **No Web App Manifest ships.** `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/manifest.json`, `/site.webmanifest` all resolve to `index.html` (SPA catch-all, `content-type: text/html`). `frontend/index.html` has **no** `<link rel="manifest">`; `frontend/public/` contains only `sse-debug.html`, `sw-push.js`, `vite.svg` — no manifest, no PWA icons.
2. **`frontend/index.html` `<head>` is minimal** (`frontend/index.html:1-13`): `<meta charset>`, `<link rel="icon" href="/vite.svg">`, `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`, `<title>Albusto</title>`. Missing: `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style`, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`, `theme-color`, `apple-touch-icon`, `viewport-fit=cover`.
3. **SPA = React Router `BrowserRouter`** (`frontend/src/App.tsx:101`); `/` → `<Navigate>` to `/pulse` (`App.tsx:111`); all in-app navigation is client-side. A manifest with `scope:"/"` therefore keeps every route inside the standalone window.
4. **Auth = Keycloak** (`frontend/src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx`): silent refresh already exists — `setInterval(... kc.updateToken(60) ...)` at `AuthProvider.tsx:261` and `kc.onTokenExpired` at `:268`. **BUT both reject-paths call `kc.login()` immediately** (`:264` inside the interval `.catch`, `:272` inside the `onTokenExpired` `.catch`). `kc.login()` is a full cross-origin redirect to `auth.albusto.com`, which is what iOS uses to **eject the standalone window into an SFSafariViewController overlay**. This is the eject trigger; missing scope (item 1) is the reinforcing trigger.
5. **The "broken layout" symptom** = SFSafariViewController's own top-bar + bottom-toolbar + different safe-area insets — NOT a CSS breakpoint bug, NOT reproducible by resizing a desktop browser.
6. **Brand:** product = **Albusto**. Warm near-white background `--blanc-surface-strong` `#fffdf9`; `theme.css` `--primary` `#030213` (near-black). Palette Т2. (`--blanc-*` tokens are internal — never render the word "Blanc" in UI.)
7. **A push service worker already exists** (`frontend/public/sw-push.js`, registered at scope `/` via `pushNotificationService.ts:33`). The manifest work is independent of it and must not disturb it.

### Binding owner decisions (interview done — these OVERRIDE any conflicting assumption)

- **D1 — All four areas ship in one run:** (A) `manifest.webmanifest` with `scope:"/"`, (B) `index.html` Apple/PWA meta, (C) brand PNG icons (letter-mark "A" in a rounded square, palette Т2), (D) auth fix.
- **D2 — Manifest values:** `start_url:"/"`, `display:"standalone"`, `scope:"/"`, `name`/`short_name` = "Albusto", warm background/theme color from the Т2 palette (`background_color` ≈ `#fffdf9`, `theme_color` pinned by the Architect from the palette — near-black `#030213` or a warm-surface value, chosen for the iOS status-bar look).
- **D3 — Icons:** brand letter-mark "A" in a rounded square, palette Т2, as PNGs: **180×180 apple-touch-icon**, **192×192**, **512×512**, and **512×512 `maskable`**. Declared in the manifest (`icons[]`) and (apple-touch) in `index.html`.
- **D4 — Auth "no-eject":** replace the instant `kc.login()` on a *transient* `updateToken` failure with a **bounded retry + backoff**; perform a **full redirect (`kc.login()`) ONLY when the refresh is genuinely dead** (e.g. `invalid_grant` / "session not active" — the refresh token is expired/revoked). Transient/network failures must NOT redirect. Both reject-sites (`:264`, `:272`) adopt the shared policy.
- **D5 — Verification:** `npm run build` (`tsc -b`; prod is stricter — `noUnusedLocals`) must stay green. Standalone-on-iOS behavior is **owner-gated manual** verification. Deploy is **owner-gated**.

### Duplication check (result)

**Not a duplicate — no PWA/manifest/install requirement exists in `Docs/requirements.md`.** Adjacent-but-distinct items: **MOBILE-NO-SOFTPHONE-001** (browser softphone is desktop-only; unrelated — the PWA is the desktop-web app installed to a Home Screen, not the softphone), **MOBILE-TECH-APP-001/002** (a *native* iOS app in a separate repo — not this web PWA), and the existing **push service worker** (`sw-push.js`, notifications — orthogonal to the manifest). This feature adds the install/standalone contract the web app has never had and hardens the one code path (`kc.login()` on transient refresh failure) that breaks it.

### 1. Problem

A user who has "Add to Home Screen"-installed app.albusto.com on their iPhone expects it to behave like an app: launch and stay in a full-screen standalone window. Instead, because (a) the site ships no manifest with a `scope`, and (b) any transient Keycloak token-refresh hiccup immediately fires a full cross-origin redirect to `auth.albusto.com`, iOS ejects the standalone window into an in-app `SFSafariViewController`. That overlay has its own chrome (top bar, bottom toolbar) and different safe-area insets, so the app looks "broken" and the user is knocked out of the app-like experience — often mid-session, with no action on their part.

### 2. Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**
- The installed PWA stays in its **standalone** window across all client-side navigation (every route under `scope:"/"`).
- A **transient** token-refresh failure no longer triggers a full-page redirect (no eject); the app self-heals via silent retry.
- The app is **installable** with correct branding: name "Albusto", warm Т2 palette, a proper "A" letter-mark icon on the Home Screen and splash (no generic screenshot icon).
- `npm run build` stays green; desktop browser and an ordinary Safari tab are **unaffected** (backward compatible).

**Non-goals (out of scope)**
- Offline capability / caching strategy / a fetch-handling service worker (the existing `sw-push.js` stays push-only; no offline app-shell in this feature).
- Android/Chrome install polish beyond what the same manifest already yields, push-notification changes, or any auth flow rework beyond the transient-vs-dead refresh decision.
- Backend, Caddy, or DNS code changes (the manifest content-type is a **deploy constraint**, noted in §7 — not a code deliverable here).
- Redesigning the login screen, session lifetimes, or the Keycloak realm.

### 3. User stories (actor = user of the installed Albusto PWA on iPhone)

1. **Stay in the app while navigating.** The user opens the installed Albusto icon, lands on Pulse, taps into a lead, a job, then Schedule — the whole time the app stays full-screen standalone; the Safari chrome never appears.
2. **Survive a network blip.** The user is on the app when the token silently needs refreshing during a brief connectivity dip; the refresh retries and succeeds, and the user never leaves the standalone window (no flash to `auth.albusto.com`, no SFSafariViewController).
3. **Real re-login only when truly needed.** The user's session has genuinely expired/been revoked; the app performs the full login redirect deliberately — the one legitimate case — and after signing in returns to the app.
4. **Install with brand identity.** A user adds app.albusto.com to the Home Screen; the icon is the Albusto "A" letter-mark in a rounded Т2-palette square (not a page screenshot), the title reads "Albusto", and launch shows the correct status-bar/splash colors.
5. **Desktop unaffected.** A user on a desktop browser or a normal mobile Safari tab sees no change — same layout, same auth behavior for a real expiry — the fix is invisible to them.

### 4. Functional requirements

#### 4.1 Web App Manifest (FR-MAN)

- **FR-MAN-1 — Ship a manifest file.** Add a real `manifest.webmanifest` served from the site root, referenced from `index.html` via `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest">`.
- **FR-MAN-2 — Install/standalone fields.** `name:"Albusto"`, `short_name:"Albusto"`, `start_url:"/"`, `display:"standalone"`, **`scope:"/"`** (covers every SPA route so client-side navigation never leaves the standalone context), `background_color` (warm near-white, ≈ `#fffdf9`), `theme_color` (Т2 palette — value pinned by the Architect for the iOS status-bar look), `orientation` optional (Architect's call).
- **FR-MAN-3 — Icons array.** `icons[]` declares the 192, 512, and 512-`maskable` PNGs (see FR-ICON) with correct `sizes`, `type:"image/png"`, and `purpose` (`"any"` / `"maskable"`).

#### 4.2 Apple / PWA `<head>` meta (FR-META)

- **FR-META-1 — Manifest + Apple capability.** In `frontend/index.html` `<head>`: `<link rel="manifest">` (FR-MAN-1), `apple-mobile-web-app-capable="yes"`, `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` (Architect picks the value to match `theme_color` — e.g. `default`/`black`/`black-translucent`), `apple-mobile-web-app-title="Albusto"`.
- **FR-META-2 — theme-color + apple-touch-icon.** `<meta name="theme-color">` matching the manifest `theme_color`; `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon-180.png">` (180×180).
- **FR-META-3 — viewport-fit=cover.** Update the existing viewport meta to `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover` so standalone respects iOS safe-area insets (pairs with any `env(safe-area-inset-*)` the app already uses).

#### 4.3 Brand icons (FR-ICON)

- **FR-ICON-1 — Produce 4 PNGs, Albusto brand.** Letter-mark "A" in a rounded square, palette Т2 (warm near-white / near-black `#030213` per the design system): **180×180** (apple-touch-icon), **192×192**, **512×512**, **512×512 maskable** (with adequate safe-zone padding so iOS/Android masking doesn't clip the "A"). Product name/identity = **Albusto** only.
- **FR-ICON-2 — Placement & wiring.** Icons live under the served static root (e.g. `frontend/public/icons/`); referenced from the manifest `icons[]` (192/512/512-maskable) and `index.html` (apple-touch 180). Files are valid PNGs at their declared pixel sizes.

#### 4.4 Auth "no-eject" hardening (FR-AUTH)

- **FR-AUTH-1 — Do not redirect on a transient refresh failure.** At both `AuthProvider.tsx:264` (interval `.catch`) and `:272` (`onTokenExpired` `.catch`), replace the immediate `kc.login()` with a shared policy: on a *transient* failure (network error / timeout / non-fatal), **retry `updateToken` with bounded backoff** (attempt count + delay pinned by the Architect); the standalone window is preserved.
- **FR-AUTH-2 — Full redirect ONLY when the refresh is genuinely dead.** Perform `kc.login()` only when the refresh token is expired/revoked / session not active (`invalid_grant` / Keycloak "session not active") — the one legitimate cross-origin re-auth case. Distinguishing transient vs. dead (error inspection / `kc.isTokenExpired` / refresh-token expiry) is pinned by the Architect.
- **FR-AUTH-3 — Silent success path unchanged.** A successful (possibly retried) refresh updates the token and re-fetches the authz context exactly as today (`setToken` + `fetchAuthzContext`); no user-visible interruption. `onAuthRefreshSuccess` (`:275`) behavior is preserved.
- **FR-AUTH-4 — Single shared policy.** Both reject-sites use one shared retry/redirect decision (no divergent copy-paste), so the "transient → retry, dead → redirect" rule is defined once.

### 5. Non-functional requirements

- **Frontend-only:** all deliverables are `frontend/` files (`index.html`, `public/manifest.webmanifest`, `public/icons/*.png`, `src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` + any small shared auth helper). No backend, no migration, no Caddy code change in this feature.
- **Backward compatible:** desktop browsers and ordinary mobile Safari tabs behave exactly as before; the manifest/meta are additive; the auth change only affects the *transient-failure* branch — a genuine expiry still redirects (story 3). No regression to the existing push service worker (`sw-push.js`), SSE bridge, or `fetchAuthzContext` flow.
- **Build gate:** `npm run build` (`tsc -b`) green, including prod-strict `noUnusedLocals` (any new helper/imports must be used); the manifest is valid JSON with a `.webmanifest` extension; icons are valid PNGs at declared sizes.
- **No secrets / no new deps required** (icon generation may be a build-time/asset step but ships static PNGs); product name in all surfaces = **Albusto**.

### 6. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1 — Scope covers all routes:** the shipped manifest has `scope:"/"`, `start_url:"/"`, `display:"standalone"`; every SPA route (`/pulse`, leads, jobs, schedule, settings, …) falls under scope, so standalone navigation stays in-window.
- **AC-2 — No eject on standalone navigation:** in the installed iOS PWA, navigating across routes and surviving a transient token refresh does NOT drop into SFSafariViewController (owner-gated manual iOS check).
- **AC-3 — Live session never full-redirects:** with a valid/refreshable session, a token refresh (including a retried transient failure) completes without any `kc.login()` full-page redirect; a genuinely expired/revoked session still redirects to login exactly once (verified by code path + manual).
- **AC-4 — Build green:** `npm run build` passes (tsc -b, `noUnusedLocals`) with the new manifest link, meta tags, and auth code.
- **AC-5 — Icons valid & branded:** the 180/192/512/512-maskable PNGs exist at their declared sizes, are referenced correctly from the manifest and `index.html`, render as the Albusto "A" letter-mark (no clipping in the maskable safe-zone), and produce a branded Home-Screen icon (manual install check).
- **AC-6 — Meta present:** `index.html` contains `<link rel="manifest">`, `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, status-bar-style, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`, `theme-color`, `apple-touch-icon`, and `viewport-fit=cover`.
- **AC-7 — Backward compatible:** desktop browser and normal Safari tab show unchanged layout and auth behavior; the push service worker and SSE/authz flows are regression-free.

### 7. Constraints & dependencies

**Frontend files touched:** `frontend/index.html` (head meta + manifest link + viewport-fit), `frontend/public/manifest.webmanifest` (new), `frontend/public/icons/*.png` (new — 180/192/512/512-maskable), `frontend/src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` (both `.catch` sites → shared retry/redirect policy; possibly a small `src/auth/` helper for the transient-vs-dead decision).

**Integrations affected:** **none** (Twilio / Front / Zenbooker / Gmail untouched). Auth provider = Keycloak (`auth.albusto.com`) — behavior changes only in the transient-refresh branch; the realm, PKCE init (`pkceMethod:'S256'`, `onLoad:'login-required'`), and genuine re-login are unchanged.

**Deploy constraint (out of code — flag for the deploy/Architect step):** in production the manifest must be served as a **real static file with `content-type: application/manifest+json`** (and the icon PNGs as their real types), NOT swallowed by the SPA `index.html` catch-all (which currently returns `text/html` for `/manifest.*`). This is a **static-serving / Caddy** concern (`Caddyfile`), not a frontend code change — it must be arranged at deploy time or the manifest won't be honored by iOS. (Vite serves `public/` at root in dev; prod static serving must not route `/manifest.webmanifest` and `/icons/*` through the SPA fallback.)

**Protected parts (must not break):**
- **Keycloak auth core:** init options (`pkceMethod:'S256'`, `onLoad:'login-required'`, `checkLoginIframe:false`), the silent-refresh mechanism itself, `onAuthRefreshSuccess`, `fetchAuthzContext` on token update, and the **genuine** re-login redirect (a truly dead session MUST still redirect).
- **Existing push service worker** `frontend/public/sw-push.js` (registered scope `/` — `pushNotificationService.ts:33`) and the SSE push bridge — the manifest/icons are additive and must not shadow or unregister it.
- **Desktop + normal-tab behavior** — no visual or auth-flow change for non-installed contexts (backward compatibility is a hard requirement).
- **Softphone (desktop-only)** and all standing locked decisions (MOBILE-NO-SOFTPHONE-001) — untouched.

**Verification note:** `npm run build` is the CI gate (per the house lesson: verify with `npm run build`, not just `tsc --noEmit` — prod Docker is stricter on `noUnusedLocals`). Standalone-on-iOS and Home-Screen-install checks are **owner-gated manual** (no automated iOS-standalone harness). Deploy is **owner-gated**; the Caddy content-type step (above) must accompany the deploy or the fix is inert on prod.

### 8. Open questions

- **OQ-1 — theme_color / status-bar-style value:** exact Т2 value for `theme_color` + matching `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` (warm surface vs. near-black `#030213`) → Architect/design, to match the desired iOS status-bar look.
- **OQ-2 — Retry policy numbers:** attempt count + backoff schedule for the transient `updateToken` retry, and the precise transient-vs-dead classifier (error string / `invalid_grant` detection / refresh-token expiry check) → Architect.
- **OQ-3 — Icon generation pipeline:** produce the 4 PNGs as committed static assets vs. a build-time generation step (from a single SVG source) → Architect/Implementer; either is acceptable so long as valid PNGs at the declared sizes ship.

### 9. Involved modules (summary)

- **New:** `frontend/public/manifest.webmanifest`; `frontend/public/icons/apple-touch-icon-180.png`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`, `icon-512-maskable.png`; optional `frontend/src/auth/` refresh-policy helper.
- **Modified:** `frontend/index.html` (Apple/PWA meta + manifest link + `viewport-fit=cover`); `frontend/src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` (both `.catch` sites → transient-retry / dead-redirect policy).
- **Backend:** **none.** **Deploy/infra (non-code):** Caddy/static serving must return `application/manifest+json` for `/manifest.webmanifest` and real image types for `/icons/*` (not the SPA `text/html` fallback).

## OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-001 — Outbound VAPI voice agent that schedules the completion visit after a part arrives, driven by a task with typed action buttons (2026-07-07)

**Status:** Requirements (Product / Agent-01) · **Priority:** P1 · **Owner:** Voice / CRM / Dispatch
**Type:** feature — **backend** (a NEW job status `Part arrived`; FSM transitions into/out of it; a status-change **hook + call-orchestration worker** that auto-creates a task and runs the outbound-call lifecycle with retries; a NEW **outbound VAPI call trigger** — `POST https://api.vapi.ai/call` — plus a NEW **outbound assistant** config; a pre-computed slot placed into the call context; write-through reschedule + status flip to `Rescheduled`) + **a reusable task sub-component — TASK-ACTIONS** (typed, backend-executed action buttons on Tasks) + **frontend** (render the action buttons on the task card; `manual_call` opens the softphone).
**Scope of v1:** **Boston Masters only** (`DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID = 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`), but all server code is written **company-scoped** for future multi-tenant rollout.

**Binding owner decisions (Step 0.5 interview — these OVERRIDE any conflicting assumption):**
- **D1 — Trigger = a task with custom buttons, NOT an auto-dial.** When a job moves to `Part arrived`, the system auto-creates a **Task** (existing Tasks system, TASKS-001) bound to that job. The task shows, besides the standard Done/Cancel, **two custom buttons**: **"🤖 Let the robot call"** (launches the outbound VAPI agent) and **"📞 I'll call myself"** (opens the softphone with the customer's number pre-filled — reuse existing click-to-call / outbound-softphone). No call happens until a human presses the robot button.
- **D2 — Generalize the buttons as typed actions (sub-component TASK-ACTIONS).** A task gains an `actions[]` field — a list of **named** actions the **backend** knows how to execute (v1 = exactly two: `robot_call`, `manual_call`). The UI renders buttons from this list plus the standard Done/Cancel. Each action's logic lives **in code** (NOT arbitrary user-defined code). TASK-ACTIONS is described as a **standalone, reusable requirements component** on which OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL stands.
- **D3 — Pre-computed slot; no live API during the call open.** On "robot call", the backend pre-computes the top slot via the existing `recommendSlots` (slot-engine) and places it into the call context (`assistantOverrides`) so the call opens with a concrete window and **no API is hit during that open**. If the customer says "no", the agent pulls alternatives **live** via `recommendSlots`. **If there are no slots OR the slot-engine errors — DO NOT call**; update the task with the reason and what the dispatcher should do.
- **D4 — No-answer / voicemail / hang-up ⇒ scheduled retries.** Retry schedule **"immediately / +2h / next business morning"** (**3 attempts**, clamped to the company's business hours; the schedule/attempt-count are configurable). **Every attempt** the robot adds a **note to the job** ("tried to reach, no answer, will try again at …"). After the 3rd unsuccessful attempt the task **stays with the dispatcher** and the job status **stays `Part arrived`**.
- **D5 — Successful booking.** The agent confirms the arrival window → **reschedule the SAME job** (write-through to Zenbooker) **+ flip status to `Rescheduled`** → the task **auto-closes (Done)**. The "3-month warranty" phrase is **NOT** used in v1 (remove from the script).
- **D6 — No re-verification.** Outbound call to a known contact: the agent does **NOT** confirm name or address (we've already been there); the pre-verified context (`contactId`) is passed into the call.
- **D7 — Never create a new lead/job.** The flow only transitions the existing job (`Part arrived → Rescheduled`) and updates its visit window. No new lead, no new job.

### Duplication check (result)

**Not a duplicate — a new outbound capability plus a reusable Tasks extension.** Adjacent, reused, and distinguished features:

- **AGENT-SKILLS-001 / -002 (`## AGENT-SKILLS-001`)** built the provider-neutral CRM **skill layer** and the **inbound** `/api/vapi-tools` adapter, and it already contains `rescheduleAppointment` (write Albusto + ZB) and identity skills. This feature **reuses the skill layer** for the reschedule + status-flip write, but is fundamentally **outbound** — AGENT-SKILLS is inbound-only (its non-goals explicitly exclude "outbound calls (different assistant type)"). This feature closes that gap with an **outbound call trigger** and a **separate outbound assistant**.
- **VAPI-SLOT-ENGINE-001 (`## VAPI-SLOT-ENGINE-001`)** established the `recommendSlots` engine call, the `smart-slot-engine` marketplace gate, and safe-fail semantics — reused verbatim to pre-compute the top slot (D3) and to pull live alternatives.
- **TASKS-001 / AR-TASK-UNIFY-001** provide the Tasks model (`tasks.thread_id`, parent job/lead/contact, `kind`, `agent_output`, `createTask` app-upsert, "open task = Action Required"). This feature **extends** it with TASK-ACTIONS (typed action buttons) and adds ONE auto-created task per `Part arrived` transition. It does **not** change the existing Tasks visibility/RBAC model or the AR-TASK-UNIFY coupling.
- **Softphone / click-to-call** (`frontend/src/contexts/SoftPhoneContext.tsx` — `useSoftPhone().openDialer(phone, contactName)`; `POST /api/voice/twiml/outbound`) is reused as-is for the `manual_call` action (desktop-only; MOBILE-NO-SOFTPHONE-001 — mobile falls back to native `tel:`).
- **On-the-way / ONWAY-001**, **CALLFLOW-BUSY-TO-AGENT-001 (inbound Sara)** — untouched; the inbound path and live Sara assistant (`30e85a87`) must not break.

### 1. Problem

Today, when a technician has done a diagnosis, ordered a part, and the part later arrives, there is **no status to mark "part arrived"** and **no workflow to re-book the completion visit**. A dispatcher must notice the part, remember which job it belongs to, call the customer, negotiate a window, reschedule the job, and push it to Zenbooker — all by hand, one job at a time. The completion visit is the highest-intent, already-won work (the customer is waiting on us), yet it's the most manual step. We want a one-press path: a robot calls the customer with a ready window, books it, reschedules the same job, and closes the loop — with a clean fallback to a human when the robot can't.

## STRIPE-ADHOC-PAY-001: collect an arbitrary Stripe payment straight from the Job card (Finance tab) — no invoice required

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Date:** 2026-07-07 · **Owner:** Frontend + one Backend task
**Type:** feature — **frontend + 1 backend task**, **NO migration** (job_id columns on `checkout_link` / `payment_transactions` and the `payments.*` perms already exist; max migration stays **155**). One run adds: (A) a gated "Collect payment" entry point + readiness/permission CTA in the Job → Finance tab, (B) a FORM-CANON collect dialog with amount + method chooser, (C) generalized manual-card + ad-hoc payment-link paths keyed to a `jobId` instead of only an `invoiceId`, (D) a standalone (invoice-free) job payment ledger row on webhook settle. **Backward-compat is a hard requirement: the existing invoice collect flow must remain byte-unchanged; every job branch is additive / behind optional props.**

### Verified ground truth (confirmed in code 2026-07-07 — do not re-derive)

1. **Stripe collect surfaces already exist for invoices.** `backend/src/services/stripePaymentsService.js` exposes `ensurePaymentLink` / `sendPaymentLink(companyId, actor, invoiceId, …)` (line 264), `resolveSurfaceContext({ invoiceId, jobId, amount })` (line 282) — which **already accepts a `jobId` + explicit `amount` branch** — and `createCardSession` (line 304), whose Stripe metadata already carries `job_id` (line 310) and whose idempotency key already falls back to `jobId`/`adhoc` (line 314). The `checkout_link` surface already has a `job_id` column (invoice_id nullable) and `payment_transactions` already has `job_id`. **No migration is needed.**
2. **The manual-card job route already exists.** `POST /api/jobs/:id/stripe-manual-card-session` is live for keyed card entry from a job. `ManualCardDialog` on the frontend currently binds to an invoice; it must be generalized to accept `{ jobId?, invoiceId?, amount }` and call the job route on the job path.
3. **The webhook already resolves `job_id` from session metadata.** The Stripe webhook writes the settled `payment_transactions` row from the PaymentIntent/session `metadata` (which includes `job_id`) — so a standalone job payment records itself **with no webhook change**.
4. **`sendPaymentLink` today only EVENT-LOGS — it does NOT prove a live dispatcher.** `stripePaymentsService.js:264` calls `invoicesQueries.createEvent(…, 'payment_link_sent', …)` + `auditService.log(…)` and returns `{ sent:true, url }`; its own inline comment says *"Actual email/SMS dispatch is handled by the shared messaging path / invoice send"* — but **no email/SMS send call is present in this function.** By contrast **SEND-DOC-001** *does* dispatch estimate/invoice docs over email (mailProvider, PDF+link) and SMS. Whether a real payment-link delivery path is wired is **unverified** — see the ⚑ OPEN ITEM at the end.
5. **Design canon:** entity edit/collect surfaces = right-side slide-over "layer" (FORM-CANON — auto bottom-sheet on mobile); fields = floating-label filled primitives; tokens only (`--blanc-*`). CTA/placeholder cards use `--blanc-surface-muted`. Product name in UI = **Albusto** (never "Blanc").

### Duplication check (result)

**Not a duplicate.** **SEND-DOC-001** sends an *estimate/invoice* document (and can attach a pay link) — it is invoice-anchored and document-centric; STRIPE-ADHOC-PAY-001 is **invoice-free** collection of an *arbitrary amount* from the job itself. Prior Stripe work built the invoice-anchored collect surfaces (payment link, keyed card, tap-to-pay) and the `payments.*` perms; this feature **reuses** those primitives (which already have latent `jobId` branches) and exposes them from the Job → Finance tab with no invoice. No existing requirement grants "collect an ad-hoc amount from a job."

### 1. Problem

A tech or dispatcher standing on a job frequently needs to take a card payment (deposit, diagnostic fee, balance, tip) **without first cutting an invoice**. Today the only Stripe collect surfaces are invoice-anchored, so the user must create a throwaway invoice just to charge a card — friction that pushes payments off-platform (cash / external terminal) and leaves the CRM ledger incomplete. The plumbing to charge a job directly already exists half-built (`resolveSurfaceContext` job branch, `job_id` metadata, the manual-card job route, the `job_id` ledger column) but is not exposed in the UI and the payment-link path is not job-generalized.

### 2. Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**
- Add a first-class **`Part arrived`** job status with correct FSM transitions.
- **Auto-create a task** (bound to the job) when a job enters `Part arrived`, carrying **typed action buttons** (`robot_call`, `manual_call`).
- On `robot_call`: **pre-compute** the best slot, place a **VAPI outbound call**, and drive a short "your part's in, let's book the finish visit" script; book on agreement.
- On success: **reschedule the same job (Albusto + ZB write-through)**, flip to **`Rescheduled`**, and **auto-close the task**.
- On no-answer: **retry ×3** on a business-hours schedule, **noting every attempt on the job**; after exhaustion, leave the task for the dispatcher.
- On no-slots / engine-error: **don't call**; explain the reason on the task.
- Generalize the buttons into a **reusable TASK-ACTIONS** sub-component (typed, backend-executed actions on tasks).

**Non-goals (out of scope)**
- **Any re-verification of identity/name/address** on the outbound call (D6) — pre-verified context only.
- **Creating a new lead or job** (D7) — only transition/reschedule the existing job.
- Payment capture by voice (never — consistent with AGENT-SKILLS-001).
- The "3-month warranty" upsell phrase (D5 — removed from v1 script).
- Multi-tenant rollout (v1 = Boston Masters / `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID`; code stays company-scoped).
- **Arbitrary user-defined task actions** — TASK-ACTIONS v1 is a **closed set** of backend-implemented action types (`robot_call`, `manual_call`); no user scripting.
- Mobile softphone for `manual_call` (desktop softphone only; mobile uses native `tel:` per MOBILE-NO-SOFTPHONE-001).
- Changing the inbound Sara assistant, the inbound `/api/vapi-tools` contract, the slot-engine scoring, or the dispatcher UI beyond rendering the new task buttons.

### 3. User stories

1. **Part arrives → task appears (S).** A job in `Waiting for parts` is moved to `Part arrived`; the system auto-creates ONE task on that job with buttons **Done / Cancel / 🤖 Let the robot call / 📞 I'll call myself**, and it surfaces as Action Required.
2. **Robot books it (happy path).** The dispatcher presses **"Let the robot call"**; the backend pre-computes the top slot and dials the customer; the agent says "Hi {name}, your part's arrived — let's schedule the finish visit," offers the ready window, the customer agrees, the agent states the **arrival window**, the job is **rescheduled (Albusto + ZB)** and flipped to **`Rescheduled`**, and the **task auto-closes (Done)**.
3. **Customer wants a different time.** The customer declines the pre-computed window; the agent pulls **live alternatives** via `recommendSlots`, offers 2–3, the customer picks one → same booking + status-flip + task-close as (2).
4. **No answer → retries → dispatcher.** The call goes to voicemail / is declined / rings out; the robot **adds a note to the job** and **retries** on "immediately / +2h / next business morning" (3 attempts, within business hours). After the 3rd failure the **task stays with the dispatcher** and the **job stays `Part arrived`**.
5. **No slots / engine error → don't call.** At robot-launch (or on a live re-pull) the slot-engine returns no availability or errors → **no call is placed**; the task is updated with the reason and the recommended dispatcher action.
6. **"I'll call myself" (manual).** The dispatcher presses **"I'll call myself"** → the **softphone opens with the customer's number pre-filled** (desktop; native `tel:` on mobile); the dispatcher books manually (no robot involved).

### 4. Functional requirements

#### 4.0 Sub-component — TASK-ACTIONS (reusable typed action buttons on Tasks)

- **FR-TA1 — `actions[]` on a task.** A task carries an ordered list of **typed actions**, each `{ type, label, icon?, state? }` where `type` is a **backend-known** action key. v1 registry = `robot_call`, `manual_call`. The value is stored on the task (new column/JSON on the tasks model, e.g. reuse/extend `agent_output`/`kind` conventions — Architect decides the exact storage; must not break the existing Tasks schema or TASKS-COUNT-BADGE/AR-TASK-UNIFY queries).
- **FR-TA2 — Backend-executed, closed registry.** Each action `type` maps to a **server-side handler** in a small action registry (NOT arbitrary user code, NOT client-authored logic). The registry is the single source of truth for "what a button does." Invoking an action = `POST /api/tasks/:id/actions/:type` (Architect confirms route shape), authenticated + `requireCompanyAccess`, scoped to `req.companyFilter.company_id`, foreign task id → 404.
- **FR-TA3 — UI renders buttons from the list.** The task card (`frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx`) renders one button per `actions[]` entry (label + optional icon), **in addition to** the standard Done/Cancel affordances — no hardcoded per-feature buttons. Disabled/loading `state` reflects an in-flight/consumed action.
- **FR-TA4 — Idempotency & auditability of an action.** An action handler is idempotent-safe (double-press does not double-fire — e.g. `robot_call` won't start a second concurrent call lifecycle). Each invocation is auditable (domain event / job note as appropriate). `manual_call` is a pure client affordance (opens the dialer) and needs no server mutation, but MAY still be logged.

#### 4.1 Job status & FSM

- **FR-1 — New status `Part arrived`.** Add `Part arrived` to the job status set (`BLANC_STATUSES`, `jobsService.js` line 25) **and** to the FSM/SCXML published machine (via a new migration that rewrites the published SCXML per company, following the mig-127 "On the way" precedent), **and** to the hardcoded `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` fallback. Required transitions: **`Waiting for parts → Part arrived`**; **`Part arrived → Rescheduled`**, **`Part arrived → Canceled`**, **`Part arrived → Follow Up with Client`**. Do not remove/reorder existing statuses, `OUTBOUND_MAP`, or the Zenbooker sync block (FSM dual-source; `jobsService` authoritative fallback).
- **FR-2 — Status change is the trigger seam.** Entering `Part arrived` (via `updateBlancStatus(jobId, 'Part arrived', companyId)` / `PATCH /api/jobs/:id/status`) fires a **hook** that enqueues the task creation + (idle) call orchestration. The hook is **fail-safe**: an error in task creation or orchestration **must NOT roll back or block** the status transition (fire-and-forget with its own error capture, mirroring `eventService.logEvent`).

#### 4.2 Auto-task on `Part arrived`

- **FR-3 — One task per transition (idempotent).** On `Part arrived`, create **exactly one** open task bound to the job (parent = job), with the two typed actions `robot_call` + `manual_call` (FR-TA1). Re-entering `Part arrived` (or a duplicate event) must **not** spawn a second open task for the same job (`createTask` app-upsert keyed on job + task kind). The task surfaces as Action Required (AR-TASK-UNIFY-001).
- **FR-4 — Task content.** The task names the customer + job + "Part arrived — schedule completion visit," so a dispatcher sees the whole picture; it opens the parent job (tasks have no own card). No new lead/job is created (D7).

#### 4.3 Outbound robot call lifecycle (`robot_call` action)

- **FR-5 — Pre-compute the slot, then dial (D3).** On `robot_call`: (a) resolve the customer phone + `contactId` from the job; (b) call `recommendSlots(companyId, ctx, { … job address/zip, durationMinutes, … })` to get the **top-1** slot; (c) **if no slots OR error → DO NOT call** (FR-9); (d) otherwise place an **outbound VAPI call** `POST https://api.vapi.ai/call` with `{ assistantId: <outbound assistant>, phoneNumberId, customer.number, assistantOverrides }`, where `assistantOverrides` carries the **pre-verified context** (`contactId`, customer first name, `jobId`) and the **pre-computed window** — so the call **opens with a concrete slot and hits no API during the open**.
- **FR-6 — Script (v1).** Greeting ≈ "Hi {name}, how are you — your part has arrived, let's schedule a visit to finish the repair," then offer the pre-computed window. **No name/address confirmation** (D6). On agreement, state the **arrival window** (a range, never an exact minute) and end. **No "3-month warranty" phrase** (D5). The outbound assistant is a **NEW, separate** VAPI assistant config (repo: `voice-agent/assistants/*.json`, modeled on `lead-qualifier-v2.json`; live push is owner-consent-gated and separate from this pipeline).
- **FR-7 — Customer declines the offered slot → live alternatives.** If the customer rejects the pre-computed window, the agent (via a skill/tool call on the outbound assistant) pulls **live** alternatives through `recommendSlots` and offers 2–3; the pick proceeds to FR-8.
- **FR-8 — Booking (success, D5).** On confirmation of a window: **reschedule the SAME job** — `scheduleService.rescheduleItem(companyId, 'job', jobId, newStartAt, newEndAt)` **WITH the Zenbooker write-through** (the AGENT-SKILLS-001 AR-4 reschedule ZB-push must be in place; if not yet wired, this feature depends on / closes that gap) — **and** flip status via `updateBlancStatus(jobId, 'Rescheduled', companyId)`, **and** record an **"AI Phone"** audit note + domain event, **and auto-close the task (Done)**. Address is NOT confirmed (D6).
- **FR-9 — No-slots / engine-error → don't call, explain on the task.** When the pre-compute (FR-5c) or a live re-pull (FR-7) yields no availability or an error, **place no call**; update the task with a human-readable **reason + recommended dispatcher action**; the job stays `Part arrived`; the task stays open with the dispatcher.

#### 4.4 Retries on no-answer

- **FR-10 — Retry schedule (D4).** No-answer / voicemail / declined / hang-up ⇒ retry on **"immediately / +2h / next business morning"**, **3 attempts total**, each clamped to the **company's business hours** (reuse the existing business-hours/tz source used by the call-flow runtime). Attempt count + backoff are **configurable** (per-company setting; Architect chooses storage — a small settings row, mirroring REC-SETTINGS-001).
- **FR-11 — Note every attempt (D4).** **Each** attempt writes a **job note** ("tried to reach {name}, no answer — next attempt at {time}") via `jobsService.addNote(jobId, text, [], author='AI Phone', createdBy='AI Phone')` (mirrors to ZB when linked) + a domain event.
- **FR-12 — Exhaustion (D4).** After the 3rd unsuccessful attempt: the **task stays open** with the dispatcher and the **job status stays `Part arrived`** (no flip). A final note records that automated attempts are exhausted and a human should follow up.
- **FR-13 — Orchestration worker.** The retry/dial lifecycle runs on a **worker/scheduler** (mirror the existing worker patterns: inbox worker, agent worker 5000 ms tick, rules-engine scheduler 60 s). It must be idempotent (no duplicate concurrent call for one task/job — FR-TA4), fail-safe (a worker error never corrupts job state), and business-hours-aware.

#### 4.5 Manual call (`manual_call` action)

- **FR-14 — Open softphone pre-filled.** `manual_call` opens the desktop softphone with the customer number + contact name pre-filled via `useSoftPhone().openDialer(phone, contactName)` (reuse SoftPhoneContext / click-to-call). On mobile, fall back to native `tel:` (MOBILE-NO-SOFTPHONE-001). No robot, no status change on press; the dispatcher books manually (which will itself reschedule + flip status through the normal job UI).

### 5. Non-functional requirements

- **Business hours / timezone:** all dialing and retry scheduling respect the **company's** business hours and timezone (reuse the call-flow runtime's business-hours source; consistent with the "render times in company tz" fix, commit 6d5975a). No calls outside business hours.
- **Idempotency:** exactly **one** open task per `Part arrived` transition; **one** active call lifecycle per task/job (no duplicate dials on double-press or duplicate events); reschedule/status-flip applied once per successful booking.
- **Fail-safe:** the `Part arrived` status transition, task creation, orchestration, and each call attempt are **decoupled and fail-safe** — an error in task/call machinery **never** rolls back the status change nor corrupts job/schedule state (fire-and-forget + isolated error capture).
- **Security (canon):** all task-action routes are `authenticate` + `requireCompanyAccess`, scoped to `req.companyFilter?.company_id`, foreign ids → 404, all SQL by `company_id`. The outbound VAPI trigger runs server-side only; the VAPI outbound API key/secret live in server env (never client). Company isolation is absolute (v1 hardwired to `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` but code stays company-scoped).
- **Graceful degradation:** slot-engine or ZB errors never crash the flow — no-slots/engine-error → don't-call + task reason (FR-9); ZB push failure on reschedule follows the existing `forceSyncOnZbError` discipline; a failed outbound-call POST is treated as a failed attempt (feeds retries).
- **Latency / cost:** the call opens with a pre-computed slot (no blocking API at open, D3); live re-pulls respect the engine's timeout + safe-fail.

### 6. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1 (status):** `Part arrived` exists in `BLANC_STATUSES`, the published SCXML, and `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`; `Waiting for parts → Part arrived` and `Part arrived → {Rescheduled, Canceled, Follow Up with Client}` are permitted; no existing status/transition is broken.
- **AC-2 (auto-task):** Moving a job to `Part arrived` creates exactly **one** open task on that job with buttons Done / Cancel / 🤖 Let the robot call / 📞 I'll call myself; re-entering the status does not create a second task; the status change is never blocked by task-creation failure.
- **AC-3 (robot happy path):** Pressing "Let the robot call" pre-computes the top slot and dials with a concrete window in the call context (no API hit at open); on agreement the SAME job is rescheduled (Albusto **and** ZB), flipped to `Rescheduled`, an "AI Phone" note is recorded, and the task auto-closes (Done).
- **AC-4 (decline → live alternatives):** A declined pre-computed slot triggers a live `recommendSlots` pull; a chosen alternative books identically to AC-3.
- **AC-5 (retries):** No-answer produces a job note per attempt and retries on immediately/+2h/next-business-morning (3 attempts, within business hours, configurable); after exhaustion the task stays with the dispatcher and status stays `Part arrived`.
- **AC-6 (no slots / error):** No availability or an engine error results in **no call placed**, a task updated with the reason + dispatcher action, and the job unchanged.
- **AC-7 (manual):** "I'll call myself" opens the desktop softphone pre-filled with the customer's number (native `tel:` on mobile); no robot, no status change on press.
- **AC-8 (no re-verification):** The outbound script never asks the customer to confirm name or address (D6).
- **AC-9 (no new lead/job):** No path creates a new lead or job; only the existing job transitions/reschedules (D7).
- **AC-10 (TASK-ACTIONS reusable):** Task buttons render from `actions[]` (not hardcoded); the action registry is a closed, backend-executed set (`robot_call`, `manual_call`); an unknown action type is rejected; a task action route is company-scoped + returns 404 on a foreign id.
- **AC-11 (isolation / fail-safe):** All server work is scoped to `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID`; a forced error in task/call/orchestration never rolls back the status transition or corrupts job/schedule state.
- **AC-12 (no warranty phrase):** The v1 outbound script contains no "3-month warranty" wording.

### 7. Constraints & dependencies

**Reuse (do NOT re-implement):**
- **Reschedule + ZB write-through:** `scheduleService.rescheduleItem(companyId, 'job', jobId, newStartAt, newEndAt)` (mutates the SAME job) + the **AGENT-SKILLS-001 AR-4 Zenbooker reschedule push** (this feature **depends on** that push existing; if `rescheduleItem` still doesn't call `zenbookerClient.rescheduleJob`, wiring it is a dependency). Status flip via `jobsService.updateBlancStatus`. `POST /api/jobs/:id/reschedule` (ZB write-through, `arrival_window_minutes`) is an alternative surface the Architect may reuse.
- **Slot pre-compute + live alternatives:** `recommendSlots` skill (slot-engine), gated on `isAppConnected(companyId, 'smart-slot-engine')`, safe-fail (VAPI-SLOT-ENGINE-001).
- **Skill layer:** the AGENT-SKILLS-001 provider-neutral skill layer (`agentSkills/`) — the outbound assistant's in-call reschedule/alternatives should go through the SAME skills, not a re-implementation; the outbound call is a NEW **consumer** (a separate assistant), the write logic is shared.
- **Tasks:** TASKS-001 model + `createTask` app-upsert + AR-TASK-UNIFY "open task = Action Required"; `frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx` for button rendering.
- **Softphone:** `frontend/src/contexts/SoftPhoneContext.tsx` `openDialer(phone, contactName)` + `POST /api/voice/twiml/outbound` (desktop; native `tel:` on mobile).
- **Business hours / tz + workers:** the call-flow runtime's business-hours/tz source; existing worker/scheduler patterns (inbox worker, agent worker 5 s, rules-engine 60 s).
- **Audit:** `jobsService.addNote(author='AI Phone')` (ZB-mirrors when linked) + `eventService.logEvent(companyId,'job',jobId,…, actorType='system')`.

**New:**
- `Part arrived` status (constant + SCXML migration + `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`).
- A status-change **hook** on `updateBlancStatus` + a **call-orchestration worker** (dial + retries).
- **TASK-ACTIONS** — `actions[]` on tasks + a backend **action registry** (`robot_call`, `manual_call`) + `POST /api/tasks/:id/actions/:type`.
- An **outbound VAPI call trigger** (server-side `POST https://api.vapi.ai/call`) + a **NEW outbound assistant** config (`voice-agent/assistants/*.json`).
- A small **per-company retry/schedule settings** row (attempt count + backoff), mirroring REC-SETTINGS-001.

**Integrations affected:** **VAPI** (NEW outbound assistant + `POST /call`; live push owner-consent-gated). **Zenbooker** (reschedule write-through + note mirror; default-company ZB account only, ZB-ISO-001; ZB reschedule/create needs `address.state`). **Twilio** (outbound softphone for `manual_call`; the VAPI outbound telephony `phoneNumberId`). **Slot-engine / smart-slot-engine marketplace app** (pre-compute + live alternatives). **Front / Stripe** — untouched.

**Protected parts (must NOT break):**
- **Inbound path:** `backend/src/routes/vapi-tools.js` auth/envelope/single-tenant contract, the existing inbound tools, and the **live Sara assistant (`30e85a87`)** — this feature is additive (a NEW outbound assistant), it does not touch the inbound assistant/endpoint.
- `src/server.js` mount order/wiring; `authedFetch`; `useRealtimeEvents`/SSE; existing DB migrations (only NEW migrations allowed, renumber if branch-parallel per parallel-dialogs rule).
- **Reschedule / merge-orphan Zenbooker semantics** — `rescheduleItem` must keep mutating the SAME job (no new job), and the ZB write-through must follow `cancelJob`'s pre-check + `forceSyncOnZbError` discipline; do not alter `OUTBOUND_MAP` or the FSM dual-source fallback.
- **Tasks:** existing Tasks schema, visibility/RBAC model, `HAS_ENTITY_PARENT`/`scopeOwnerId`, TASKS-COUNT-BADGE-001 count query, and AR-TASK-UNIFY-001 coupling — TASK-ACTIONS is additive.
- **Softphone canon** — desktop-only softphone (MOBILE-NO-SOFTPHONE-001); the intentional warm-up modal stays; `answerOnBridge="true"` untouched.
- Tenancy/isolation — v1 runs only within `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID`; no cross-tenant read/write introduced.

**Verify against a real DB / real ZB (not just mocked jest):** exercise the real `Part arrived` transition + auto-task, a real robot booking (Albusto reschedule + ZB push + status flip + task close), a real no-answer retry cycle (job notes + business-hours clamp), and the no-slots/error path, on a prod-DB copy, before any deploy. **Prod deploy and the live VAPI outbound-assistant push are owner-consent-gated (standing rule).**

### 8. Open questions

- **OQ-1 — Retry timing precision.** Exact "next business morning" anchor (e.g. 09:00 company-local?) and the transient-vs-terminal classification of a VAPI/Twilio call result (voicemail vs. declined vs. failed-to-place) → Architect.
- **OQ-2 — TASK-ACTIONS storage.** Whether `actions[]` reuses/extends the existing tasks `agent_output`/`kind` columns or gets its own column/table, without breaking TASKS-COUNT-BADGE / AR-TASK-UNIFY queries → Architect.
- **OQ-3 — Outbound `phoneNumberId` & caller ID.** Which VAPI-registered number / Twilio caller ID the outbound assistant dials from (per-company) → Architect / Ops.
- **OQ-4 — Arrival-window length.** The `arrival_window_minutes` used when stating the window and writing the ZB reschedule (reuse ONWAY-001 / job default vs. a new setting) → Architect / Ops.
- **OQ-5 — Concurrency / duplicate-guard key.** The exact idempotency key that prevents a second concurrent robot call for one job/task (task id? job id + kind? a lifecycle-state column?) → Architect.

### 9. Involved modules (summary)

- **New:** `Part arrived` status + SCXML migration; a status-change hook + call-orchestration worker; TASK-ACTIONS action registry + `POST /api/tasks/:id/actions/:type`; an outbound VAPI call trigger + NEW outbound assistant config; a per-company retry-settings row.
- **Modified:** `jobsService.js` (`BLANC_STATUSES`, `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`, `updateBlancStatus` hook); `scheduleService.rescheduleItem` (ensure ZB push per AGENT-SKILLS-001 AR-4); Tasks model (`actions[]`) + `TaskCard.tsx` (render buttons); `SoftPhoneContext` consumer for `manual_call` (reuse, likely no change).
- **Reused unchanged (called):** `recommendSlots`/slot-engine, `agentSkills` reschedule skill, `createTask`, `jobsService.addNote`, `eventService.logEvent`, `zenbookerClient.rescheduleJob`, `SoftPhoneContext.openDialer`, `marketplaceService.isAppConnected`.
- **Repo config:** NEW `voice-agent/assistants/<outbound-parts>.json` (script + tool-defs; live push separate / owner-gated).

- From **Job → Finance tab**, a permitted user on a Stripe-ready company can collect an **arbitrary** amount (prefilled to the job's outstanding balance) via keyed card, a hosted payment link, or a copied link — **with no invoice created**.
- The charge lands as **one `payment_transactions` row carrying `job_id` and no invoice**, via the existing webhook (no webhook change, no auto-invoice).
- Clear readiness/permission states: a proper CTA when Stripe isn't connected/finished, and nothing at all when the user can't collect.
- **The invoice collect flow is byte-unchanged**; `npm run build` + backend jest stay green.

**Non-goals (out of scope)**
- Any change to the invoice collect flow, `PublicInvoicePayPage`, or the webhook.
- A new migration or new perms (all exist).
- Refunds, partial captures, saved cards, subscriptions, or tap-to-pay UI changes (tap-to-pay stays as-is; this feature is button/link/keyed-card).
- Building net-new email/SMS delivery infrastructure — "Send payment link" **reuses** whatever dispatcher exists (see ⚑ OPEN ITEM); "Copy link" is the guaranteed hand-off.

### 3. User stories (actor = tenant_admin / manager / dispatcher / provider with a `payments.collect_*` perm, on a Stripe-ready company)

1. **Charge a card on the spot.** On a job with a $180 outstanding balance, the user opens Finance → **Collect payment**, sees $180 prefilled (editable), picks **Enter card manually**, keys the customer's card, and the payment records against the job — no invoice.
2. **Send a pay link.** The user chooses **Send payment link**; the customer's card-holder link goes to the job's contact (email and/or SMS) and the customer pays on Stripe's hosted page.
3. **Copy a link to paste anywhere.** The user chooses **Copy payment link**, gets the URL, and pastes it into their own text thread — reliable regardless of send-channel wiring.
4. **Guided when Stripe isn't ready.** An admin who hasn't connected Stripe sees a CTA card ("Accept payments right from the job…") with **[Connect Stripe]** routing to Settings → Integrations → Stripe Payments; if setup is half-done they see **[Finish setup]**.
5. **Non-admin nudge.** A user with collect perms but *without* integration-manage perms, on an unready company, sees plain text: "Ask an account admin to connect Stripe in Settings → Integrations." (no button).
6. **Invisible to the unpermitted.** A user with no collect perm sees **nothing** — no button, no CTA — in the Finance tab.

### 4. Functional requirements

#### 4.1 Button + gating (FR-BTN)
- **FR-BTN-1 — Gated "Collect payment" button.** In `JobFinancialsTab`, render a **Collect payment** button **iff** Stripe account status is `connected_ready` **AND** the user holds **any** of `payments.collect_online` / `payments.collect_offline` / `payments.collect_keyed`.
- **FR-BTN-2 — No collect perm → render nothing.** If the user holds none of the three collect perms, render **nothing** in the collect area (no button, no CTA, no placeholder).

#### 4.2 Readiness CTA / placeholder (FR-CTA)
- **FR-CTA-1 — CTA when permitted but Stripe not ready.** User HAS a collect perm but Stripe is **not** `connected_ready` → show an English CTA card on `--blanc-surface-muted` (FORM-CANON styling, tokens only).
- **FR-CTA-2 — Copy + routing per readiness state (integration-manage users):**
  - `not_connected` → title **"Accept payments right from the job"**, body **"Connect Stripe to charge your customer's card or send a payment link in seconds — no invoice required."**, action **[Connect Stripe]**.
  - `onboarding_incomplete` / `action_required` → body **"Finish your Stripe setup to start collecting payments"**, action **[Finish setup]**.
  - Both actions route to **Settings → Integrations → Stripe Payments**.
- **FR-CTA-3 — Non-manage users.** User lacks `tenant.integrations.manage` → show plain text **"Ask an account admin to connect Stripe in Settings → Integrations."** with **no button**.

#### 4.3 Collect dialog (FR-DLG)
- **FR-DLG-1 — FORM-CANON surface.** A `CollectPaymentDialog` follows FORM-CANON: right-side panel on desktop, auto bottom-sheet on mobile; `DialogPanelHeader` / `DialogBody` / `DialogPanelFooter`; floating-label filled fields; tokens only.
- **FR-DLG-2 — Amount field.** Prefilled to the job's **outstanding** amount (`totalInvoiced − totalPaid` if `> 0`, else blank); **editable**; validated **min $0.50 / max $100,000 / 2 decimal places**.
- **FR-DLG-3 — Method chooser.** Three methods: **Enter card manually** / **Send payment link** / **Copy payment link**.

#### 4.4 Manual card — arbitrary amount (FR-CARD) — frontend only
- **FR-CARD-1 — Generalize `ManualCardDialog`.** Accept `{ jobId?, invoiceId?, amount }`. The **job** path calls the existing **`POST /api/jobs/:id/stripe-manual-card-session`**; the invoice path is unchanged.
- **FR-CARD-2 — No backend change to the card route**, but the shared amount validation (`assertAdhocAmount`, FR-LINK amount rules: min/max/2dp) applies to the keyed-card amount as well.

#### 4.5 Ad-hoc job payment link (FR-LINK) — backend + frontend
- **FR-LINK-1 — Generalize the Checkout-session/link builder to `{ jobId, amount }`.** The link reuses the existing **`checkout_link`** surface with **`job_id` set and `invoice_id` NULL** — **no migration** (columns exist).
- **FR-LINK-2 — New job-scoped routes (all company-scoped):**
  - `POST /api/jobs/:id/stripe-payment-link` — create/reuse a link — perm **`payments.collect_online`**.
  - `GET /api/jobs/:id/stripe-payment-link` — read the current link — perm **`payments.view`**.
  - `POST /api/jobs/:id/send-payment-link` — send the link — perm **`payments.collect_online`**.
- **FR-LINK-3 — Idempotent.** Reuse a valid open job session; idempotency key **`job-${companyId}-${jobId}-${amount}`**.
- **FR-LINK-4 — Recipient resolution + channels.** Resolve the recipient from the **job's contact** (`jobsService.getJobById` → `contact_id` / email / phone); **send to whichever channel(s) exist** (email and/or SMS). If **neither** exists → **422 `NO_CONTACT`**. **Copy** returns the link URL (no send).

#### 4.6 Standalone (invoice-free) job payment ledger (FR-LEDGER)
- **FR-LEDGER-1 — One `payment_transactions` row with `job_id`, no invoice.** The existing webhook resolves `job_id` from session metadata — **no webhook change**.
- **FR-LEDGER-2 — Idempotency mirrors the invoice path** (same settle/dedup guarantees).
- **FR-LEDGER-3 — No auto-created invoice** on a standalone job payment.

### 5. Non-functional requirements

- **Scope:** frontend + **one** backend task. **NO migration** (`checkout_link.job_id`, `payment_transactions.job_id`, and the `payments.*` perms already exist; **max migration stays 155**).
- **Backward compatible:** the **invoice** collect flow (link create/send, keyed card, hosted pay page, webhook, ledger) is **byte-unchanged**; every job path is **additive** (new routes, additive service branches, optional dialog props). No regression to SEND-DOC-001, the webhook, or `PublicInvoicePayPage`.
- **Company-scope on every route** (`:id` resolved within the caller's company; cross-tenant job ids 404).
- **Public pay = Stripe-HOSTED Checkout** — the customer pays on Stripe's page (our `PublicInvoicePayPage` is **not** used and stays untouched). The job link's Stripe **success redirect targets a generic `/pay/thanks`** page, which **MUST exist** or the Stripe redirect 404s (payment still settles via the webhook, but the customer sees a 404).
- **Build/test gate:** `npm run build` (`tsc -b`, prod-strict `noUnusedLocals`) green; backend **jest** green.
- **Product name = Albusto** in all UI; tokens only (`--blanc-*`).

### 6. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1 — Button gating:** the **Collect payment** button shows **only** when Stripe is `connected_ready` AND the user has ≥1 `payments.collect_*`; with no collect perm the collect area is empty (FR-BTN-1/2).
- **AC-2 — CTA copy per state + per permission:** each readiness state (`not_connected` / `onboarding_incomplete` / `action_required`) shows its specified title/body/action and routes to Settings → Integrations → Stripe Payments for manage-users; non-manage users see the "Ask an account admin…" text with no button (FR-CTA-1/2/3).
- **AC-3 — Arbitrary manual-card:** keying a card for an arbitrary amount records **one** `payment_transactions` row against the **job** with **no invoice** (FR-CARD, FR-LEDGER).
- **AC-4 — Link create/send/copy + reuse:** creating, sending, and copying a job link works; a repeat create for the same `{companyId, jobId, amount}` **reuses** the open session (FR-LINK-1/3); send resolves the job contact's channels and **422 `NO_CONTACT`** when neither email nor phone exists (FR-LINK-4).
- **AC-5 — Invoice flow byte-unchanged:** the invoice collect path (link/keyed/webhook/ledger/hosted page) is unchanged (diff shows only additive job branches).
- **AC-6 — Build + tests green:** `npm run build` and backend `jest` pass.
- **AC-7 — Amount validation enforced:** min **$0.50** / max **$100,000** / **2dp** enforced on **both** the payment-link **and** the keyed-card amount (`assertAdhocAmount`).

### 7. Constraints & dependencies

**Backend (one task):** generalize the Checkout-session/link builder to `{ jobId, amount }` reusing the `checkout_link` surface (`job_id` set, `invoice_id` NULL); add job-scoped routes `POST/GET /api/jobs/:id/stripe-payment-link` and `POST /api/jobs/:id/send-payment-link` (perms: create/send = `payments.collect_online`, read = `payments.view`); shared `assertAdhocAmount` (min $0.50 / max $100,000 / 2dp) applied to link **and** keyed-card; idempotency key `job-${companyId}-${jobId}-${amount}`; recipient from `jobsService.getJobById` (contact email/phone), 422 `NO_CONTACT` when neither. **No webhook change** (metadata `job_id` already resolved). **No migration.**

**Frontend:** `JobFinancialsTab` (gated button + readiness/permission CTA on `--blanc-surface-muted`); new `CollectPaymentDialog` (FORM-CANON, amount + 3-way method chooser); generalize `ManualCardDialog` to `{ jobId?, invoiceId?, amount }` (job path → `POST /api/jobs/:id/stripe-manual-card-session`); a generic **`/pay/thanks`** success page (Stripe hosted-checkout redirect target — must exist).

**Integrations affected:** **Stripe** (Connect account, hosted Checkout, PaymentIntent/session metadata, webhook). Twilio/Front/Zenbooker/Gmail untouched — except that "Send payment link" delivery would ride whatever email/SMS dispatcher SEND-DOC-001 uses (see ⚑ OPEN ITEM). No new perms.

**Protected parts (must not break):**
- The **invoice** Stripe collect flow (ensurePaymentLink/sendPaymentLink for invoices, keyed card on invoices, the webhook, `PublicInvoicePayPage`, invoice ledger) — byte-unchanged.
- The **webhook** settle/dedup logic and the tap-to-pay surface — untouched.
- Company-scope / RBAC on every payments route.

**Verification note:** `npm run build` + backend `jest` are the CI gates. Live card charges are **owner-gated manual** (Stripe test-mode); deploy is **owner-gated**.

### 8. ⚑ OPEN ITEM for the Spec Writer (verified concern — record explicitly, do NOT silently assume "Send" delivers)

**The payment-link *send* path may not have a live dispatcher.** `stripePaymentsService.js:264` `sendPaymentLink` today **only event-logs** (`invoicesQueries.createEvent('payment_link_sent', …)`) + audit-logs and returns `{ sent:true, url }`; its own comment defers to a *"shared messaging path / invoice send"* but **no email/SMS send call is present in the function.** By contrast **SEND-DOC-001** *does* dispatch estimate/invoice documents over email (mailProvider, PDF + link) and SMS.

**Spec must verify** whether a real send path exists to wire for the payment link — the SEND-DOC-001 email (mailProvider) / SMS (Twilio) infrastructure — so **FR-LINK "Send payment link" actually delivers**. If a genuine dispatcher exists, wire "Send" to it (email and/or SMS per FR-LINK-4). **If it is genuinely absent in v1, "Copy link" is the reliable hand-off and "Send" is best-effort/deferred** — and that must be stated as an explicit requirement note, not assumed. This is a **requirement note**, not an assumption that Send works.

### 9. Involved modules (summary)

- **Backend (modified):** `backend/src/services/stripePaymentsService.js` (job-generalized link builder + `assertAdhocAmount` + job idempotency key + contact-channel resolution); job routes for `stripe-payment-link` (POST/GET) and `send-payment-link` (POST); reuse of `jobsService.getJobById`. **No webhook change. No migration.**
- **Frontend (modified/new):** `JobFinancialsTab` (button + CTA), new `CollectPaymentDialog`, generalized `ManualCardDialog` ({jobId?,invoiceId?,amount}), new generic `/pay/thanks` success page.
- **Unchanged (protected):** invoice collect flow, webhook, `PublicInvoicePayPage`, tap-to-pay, all `payments.*` perms and DB columns (already present).

## OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-BTN-001 — surface the part-arrived task's action buttons (Job card + Pulse AR) + confirm on the robot call

**Relationship:** completes the FR-TA (TASK-ACTIONS) slice of OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-001. The typed-action backend (`taskActions/registry.js`, execute route `POST /api/tasks/:id/actions/:type`, `tasks.actions` jsonb — mig 157) and the `TaskCard` renderer already shipped, but the read projection never returns `actions`, so the buttons render nowhere. This is a **bug-fix** (data plumbing) + a small **enhancement** (second surface + confirm). NOT a new subsystem.

**Brief:** when a part arrives, `partsCallService.onPartArrived` creates one OPEN, job-parented task `kind='part_arrived_call'` carrying `actions=[{robot_call,'🤖 Let the robot call'},{manual_call,"📞 I'll call myself"}]`. A dispatcher must SEE and TRIGGER those two actions from (a) the **Job card** task stack and (b) the **Pulse "Action Required"** banner. 🤖 dials the customer via the robot, so it must **confirm** first; 📞 just opens the dialer with no confirm.

**User scenarios:**
1. Dispatcher opens the Job card of a job whose part just arrived → the pinned task shows two buttons; 🤖 asks "Start automated call to the customer?" then queues the robot call; 📞 opens the softphone (desktop) / native dialer (mobile) with no confirm.
2. Dispatcher working the Pulse "Action Required" banner for a timeline-parented action task sees the same two buttons with the same behavior, without leaving Pulse.
3. A pre-call failure (no slots / no phone) shows a short reason under 🤖 after refresh; the dispatcher falls back to 📞.
4. A user WITHOUT `tasks.manage` sees no action buttons on either surface (they could not execute them — the route requires `tasks.manage`).

**Constraints / non-functional:**
- **No new migration** (the `actions` column is live — mig 157); no change to the execute route, the registry, or the outbound-call lifecycle.
- The action-button gate MUST match the route gate (`tasks.manage`) on both surfaces — never show a button that 403s.
- Confirm on `robot_call` only; `manual_call` dials with no confirm.
- English UI copy; `--blanc-*` tokens only; FORM-CANON (`window.confirm` acceptable — Architect's call).
- `npm run build` (`tsc -b`, `noUnusedLocals`) green; backend jest green. Company-scope unchanged (execute route already scopes to `req.companyFilter.company_id`).

**Potentially involved modules:** backend `db/tasksQueries.js` (read projection), `db/timelinesQueries.js` + `routes/calls.js` (Pulse open_task); frontend `components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx` + new `TaskActionButtons.tsx`, `pages/PulsePage.tsx`, `types/pulse.ts`.

**Affected integrations:** none directly (Twilio/VAPI/Zenbooker only via the already-shipped robot-call lifecycle behind the unchanged execute route).

**Protected parts (must not break):** the execute route `POST /api/tasks/:id/actions/:type` + `taskActions/registry.js` (byte-unchanged); `authedFetch.ts` / `useRealtimeEvents.ts`; TASKS-COUNT-BADGE / AR-TASK-UNIFY task queries (the `actions` column stays additive/nullable); the Pulse by-contact pagination SQL contract (LIST-PAGINATION-001) — additive columns only.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- **AC-BTN-1:** every task read payload (`getTaskById` / `listEntityTasks` / `listTasks` + createTask return) includes `actions` when present (null otherwise).
- **AC-BTN-2:** the Job-card task stack renders one button per action; 🤖 confirms then POSTs; 📞 dials with no confirm.
- **AC-BTN-3:** the Pulse `open_task` carries `actions`; the AR banner renders the same buttons via the shared component for a timeline-parented action task.
- **AC-BTN-4:** no `tasks.manage` → no buttons on either surface.
- **AC-BTN-5:** `npm run build` + backend jest green; execute route / registry diff-free.

**⚑ Note for downstream agents (verified in code):** the part-arrived task is **job-parented** (`onPartArrived` → `parentType:'job'`, no `thread_id`). The Pulse AR `open_task` LATERAL matches only `thread_id = tl.id` (timeline-parented tasks). So THIS feature's task surfaces on the **Job card** today; the Pulse-AR wiring is correct and future-proofs any timeline-parented action task, but the part-arrived task will not appear in Pulse AR unless `onPartArrived` also thread-links it (separate change, out of scope).

# MAIL-LOCAL-LLM-001 — Route Mail Secretary triage to a local Ollama LLM

**Status:** requirements (2026-07-08). **Type:** integration / behavior-change (backend only).
**Builds on** MAIL-AGENT-001 (`Docs/specs/MAIL-AGENT-001.md`) — that pipeline (exclusion DSL, gate,
task upsert, `mail_agent_reviews` logging, fail-quiet) is UNCHANGED; only the classifier's LLM
transport is swapped. **Motivation:** the 2026-07-08 Gemini monthly spend-cap outage killed email
triage; a local model is $0 and outage-resilient. A 100-email identical-prompt benchmark validated
`qwen2.5:14b` (92% task/no-task agreement, ~1 false-positive/50, 100% valid JSON). Speed is
explicitly non-critical. Surface: `backend/src/services/mailAgentClassifier.js` (`classifyEmail`).

### Functional
- **R1 — Transport swap.** When the provider is `ollama`, `classifyEmail(input)` sends the combined
  prompt to Ollama `POST {url}/api/generate` (model = `MAIL_AGENT_OLLAMA_MODEL`) instead of Gemini
  `v1beta …:generateContent`. Same `input` object (`fromName/fromEmail/subject/bodyText/knownContact/
  contactName`), same success return `{ verdict, model, latency_ms }`, same throw-on-exhausted-retries.
- **R2 — Provider valve.** `MAIL_AGENT_PROVIDER=ollama` (default) `| gemini`. The existing Gemini path
  is kept dormant and byte-for-byte behavior-equivalent to today so a single env flip is an instant
  revert (spend-cap regression insurance).
- **R3 — Config (env, all defaulted).** `MAIL_AGENT_OLLAMA_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:11434`);
  **NEW** `MAIL_AGENT_OLLAMA_MODEL` (default `qwen2.5:14b`) — MUST be a new var, do **not** reuse
  `MAIL_AGENT_MODEL` (prod `.env` may point it at a Gemini string); `MAIL_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS` default
  raised `15000`→`60000`; `MAIL_AGENT_RETRY_MAX` retained (same retry/backoff loop).
- **R4 — Prompt & parse fidelity.** `SYSTEM_PROMPT` text and `buildUserPrompt()` stay **byte-identical**;
  the same concatenated prompt is what Ollama receives. `parseVerdict()`, `CATEGORIES`, and the verdict
  shape (`needs_attention/category/confidence/priority/reason/task_title`) are unchanged; request JSON
  output (`format:"json"`, `stream:false`) and reuse the existing fence-tolerant parse.
- **R5 — Review logging.** The `model` recorded in `mail_agent_reviews` reflects the model actually
  used (the Ollama model name when `provider=ollama`); `latency_ms` measurement is preserved.

### Non-functional / constraints
- **NFR-1 — Failure parity (identical to today).** Ollama unreachable/HTTP-error/timeout after
  `MAIL_AGENT_RETRY_MAX` → `classifyEmail` throws → `reviewInboundEmail` writes `verdict='error'`,
  creates **no** task, pipeline continues (mailAgentService.js l.159–166).
- **NFR-2 — No downstream change.** mailAgentService orchestration, the **0.6 confidence gate**
  (lives in mailAgentService.js l.178, NOT the classifier), task creation, `mail_agent_reviews`,
  `mailAgentRules.js`/exclusion DSL — untouched. The `POST /dry-run` path (also calls `classifyEmail`)
  inherits the swap automatically.
- **NFR-3 — Speed non-critical.** No latency SLA; the 60 s timeout accommodates local 14B inference.
- **NFR-4 — Isolation.** Call summaries (`callSummaryService.js`) STAY on Gemini; only the mail-triage
  classifier transport changes.

### Out of scope
- No DB migration, no new/changed API routes, no frontend, no new npm dependency.
- No change to `SYSTEM_PROMPT` / `buildUserPrompt` / `parseVerdict` / `CATEGORIES` / verdict shape.

### Owner hard constraints (binding)
- **C1 — NO Google Local Services special-casing:** no sender allowlists, no per-category branches,
  no prompt tweaks. Minimal faithful transport swap only.
- **C2 — NO other enhancements** beyond the swap + config valve.
- **C3 — Deploy blocker (do NOT deploy):** prod (Vultr) cannot yet reach the mini's Ollama
  (localhost-only today); commit to master is OK, deploy is gated on reachability + standing owner consent.

### Deviations / risks noted
- **Reachability gap** — prod→mini Ollama is not reachable today; flagged as a deploy blocker (out of
  this feature's code scope). Verification is therefore local-only until networking is solved.
- **`MAIL_AGENT_MODEL` reuse trap** — the dedicated new `MAIL_AGENT_OLLAMA_MODEL` var (R3) exists
  specifically because prod's `MAIL_AGENT_MODEL` likely holds a Gemini model id; reusing it would send
  a Gemini string to Ollama.
## OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-SLOTPICK-001 — dispatcher picks the time slot the robot offers (REUSE the reschedule modal for the robot-call confirm)

> **⚑ REVISED per owner redirect (2026-07-08):** REUSE the existing reschedule form `CustomTimeModal.tsx` (only header + CTA differ) instead of a new dialog; DROP the task-keyed recs route (the modal fetches recs itself via the existing `/api/schedule/slot-recommendations`); the modal emits ISO start/end and the SERVER converts ISO→company-tz `slot_json`; invalid slot → **400** surfaced live in the modal. The AC IDs below are kept; AC-SP-1/-3/-4/-5 are revised to the reuse model.

**Relationship:** extends OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-001 / -BTN-001. Today 🤖 "Let the robot call" fires a bare `window.confirm` and the backend silently auto-computes the top slot (`startRobotCall` → `recommendSlots.run` → `slots[0]`). The dispatcher never sees or influences the time the robot will offer the customer. This feature replaces the confirm by **reusing the reschedule form `CustomTimeModal` (recs + technician timelines + map)** and makes the dispatcher's chosen slot the outbound attempt's `slot_json`. Enhancement, not a new subsystem — reuses the shipped registry / execute route / outbound lifecycle / slot engine AND the reschedule modal.

**Brief:** clicking 🤖 opens `CustomTimeModal` (via a thin wrapper) with header "Schedule the robot call" and CTA "Queue robot call". It shows (a) ranked slot-engine recommendations for that job and (b) the technician timelines/map for a **manual pick** — both already built in the modal. The dispatcher must EXPLICITLY pick a slot (a recommendation OR a manual timeline click) before the CTA enables; on confirm the wrapper POSTs the chosen ISO window, the server validates + builds the canonical `slot_json`, and enqueues one outbound attempt that offers that window to the customer. The 📞 `manual_call` button is unchanged.

**⚑ BINDING DECISION (owner-confirmed) — recommendations are a CONVENIENCE, not a gate.** A manual timeline pick is ALWAYS available, never a fallback-only branch. If the engine returns no recommendations OR is unavailable OR the app is off, the modal does **NOT** block — its recs column is simply empty and the dispatcher clicks a time on a technician lane and still queues. The CTA is ENABLED whenever a slot is selected (a recommendation OR a manual pick) and DISABLED only when none is (`disabled={!selectedSlot}` — the modal's existing guard). There is **no silent auto-compute on the dispatcher path** — the dispatcher always supplies the slot. (This SUPERSEDES the earlier draft "Decision E".)

**User scenarios:**
1. Dispatcher clicks 🤖 on a part-arrived task → modal opens with ranked recommendations → clicks the top one → "Queue robot call" → the robot will offer that window to the customer.
2. Dispatcher clicks a lower-ranked recommendation → the queued window reflects the chosen one.
3. Dispatcher ignores the recs and clicks a free block on a technician timeline → the queued window is the hand-picked one (recommendations present or not).
4. Engine returns nothing / is unavailable / app is off (or the user lacks `schedule.dispatch`) → the recs column is empty but the timelines still render; a manual pick still queues the call (never forced to 📞).
5. A user without `tasks.manage` sees no 🤖 button on either surface (Job card + Pulse AR); the robot-call slot is pinned across retries (the worker re-offers the same window on no-answer/voicemail).

**Constraints / non-functional:**
- **No new migration** (`outbound_call_attempts.slot_json` is live); no change to the schedule recs route, the registry action contract, the outbound worker/VAPI lifecycle, or the CustomTimeModal layout/recs/`onConfirm` payload/`disabled` guard.
- The chosen slot is validated **server-side** and the canonical `slot_json` (`key` + `label`) is built server-side from the modal's ISO window — the client label is NEVER trusted.
- Recommendations come from the EXISTING `/api/schedule/slot-recommendations` (the modal fetches them with the wrapper-supplied job coords); NO task-keyed recs route is added.
- The 🤖 modal is the SINGLE confirmation (no extra `window.confirm`); 📞 `manual_call` dials with no confirm.
- Company-scoped on every query (`req.companyFilter.company_id`); a foreign task id → 404. English UI; existing modal styles/tokens; mobile-responsive (the modal already is). `npm run build` + backend jest green.

**Potentially involved modules:** backend `services/partsCallService.js` (ISO→slot_json `buildRobotCallSlot` + slot passthrough), `services/agentSkills/skills/recommendSlots.js` (export `formatSlotLabel`), `routes/tasks.js` (`req.body.slot` threading + `invalid_slot`→400), `services/taskActions/registry.js` (pass `slot`), `db/timelinesQueries.js` + `routes/calls.js` (Pulse open_task carries `parent_id`/`parent_type`); frontend `components/conversations/CustomTimeModal.tsx` (additive `title?`/`confirmLabel?`), NEW `components/tasks/RobotCallSlotModal.tsx` (wrapper: `getJob` + configured modal + POST), `components/tasks/TaskActionButtons.tsx` (open the wrapper + `jobId` prop), `components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx` + `pages/PulsePage.tsx` + `types/pulse.ts` (pass `jobId`), `components/tasks/tasksApi.ts` (`runTaskAction` optional body).

**Affected integrations:** Albusto slot engine (recommendations, read-only via the existing schedule route/`slotEngineService`); VAPI/Twilio only via the already-shipped robot-call lifecycle behind the unchanged worker.

**Protected parts (must not break):** the schedule recs route + `fetchSlotRecommendations` + `slotRecommendationsApi.ts` (untouched); CustomTimeModal layout/recs/`onConfirm` payload/`disabled` guard (reschedule + new-job callers omit the new props → byte-identical); `taskActions/registry.js` action contract + execute route envelope (body becomes optional — additive; `invalid_slot`→400 is the only new branch); the outbound worker `slot_json` copy-forward + `outboundCallService` `variableValues`; `authedFetch.ts` / `useRealtimeEvents.ts`; the `startRobotCall` auto-compute path (kept for non-dispatcher callers passing no `slot`); TASKS-COUNT-BADGE / AR-TASK-UNIFY / LIST-PAGINATION queries (Pulse projection additive-columns only).

**Acceptance criteria:**
- **AC-SP-1 (revised):** clicking 🤖 opens `CustomTimeModal` (via the wrapper; no `window.confirm`) with header "Schedule the robot call" + CTA "Queue robot call"; recommendations load from the existing schedule route; the technician timelines allow a manual pick; the CTA stays `disabled` until a slot is selected.
- **AC-SP-2:** the CTA is enabled iff a slot is selected (recommendation OR manual timeline pick), disabled otherwise; no-recs/engine-off/app-off (or no `schedule.dispatch`) → a manual pick still queues (NOT blocked).
- **AC-SP-3 (revised):** the chosen ISO window is POSTed as `{ slot:{ startIso, endIso } }`; the server converts ISO→company-tz `date`/`start`/`end`, validates (valid ISO, `start<end`, same-day, not past, ≤60d horizon) and builds `slot_json` (`key`+`label` server-side, `techName`/`confidence` null); an invalid slot → **HTTP 400** `reason:'invalid_slot'`, nothing enqueued, `recommendSlots` not run, task not stamped, modal stays open.
- **AC-SP-4 (revised):** recommendations come from the EXISTING `POST /api/schedule/slot-recommendations` (gated `schedule.dispatch`) fed with the wrapper's server-derived job coords; NO new route. The 🤖 button gates `tasks.manage`; a user with `tasks.manage` but not `schedule.dispatch` sees empty recs but can still manual-pick and queue.
- **AC-SP-5 (revised):** the dispatcher-chosen slot is pinned across retries; both surfaces (Job card + Pulse AR) share `TaskActionButtons` → the `RobotCallSlotModal` wrapper → `CustomTimeModal` (the Pulse open_task carries `parent_id` so the wrapper can `getJob`); `npm run build` + backend jest green; schedule recs route / CustomTimeModal reschedule behavior / outbound lifecycle diff-free.


## OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-TECHSLOT-001 — the robot offers ONE technician's real windows; block multi-tech jobs; in-call day / day+time handling (2026-07-09)

**Relationship:** extends OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-001 / -BTN-001 / -SLOTPICK-001. SLOTPICK let the dispatcher pick the OPENING window the robot offers; this feature makes the robot's IN-CALL alternatives come from **one specific technician** (the one the dispatcher picked) and adds day / day+time handling when the customer counter-proposes. It also forbids the robot call on jobs with 2+ technicians and scopes the desktop reschedule recommendations to the job's current technician. **Enhancement, not a new subsystem** — reuses the shipped slot engine, the schedule recs route, `CustomTimeModal`, the outbound worker/VAPI lifecycle, and `recommendSlots`. **The crux: NO slot-engine algorithm change — the engine already ranks across whatever `technicians` array it is handed (`slot-engine/src/engine.js:67,144`) and already honors `earliest_allowed_date`/`latest_allowed_date` (`:75-79`); single-tech = pass a ONE-element technicians array (input shaping in the backend proxy).**

**⚑ BINDING DECISIONS (owner-confirmed, 2026-07-09):**
- **First tech of a 2+ job = `assigned_techs[0]` under a deterministic (stable, by-id) ordering.**
- **In-call nearest-to-time = exactly ONE nearest window** (not a list).
- **Req-1 gate is enforced on BOTH surfaces:** a human message in the modal AND a server-side reject in `partsCallService.startRobotCall` (`reason:'multi_tech'`) so it cannot be bypassed.
- **Assignment is preserved on reschedule** (time-only; both techs stay assigned — already true via `scheduleService.rescheduleItem`, never touched).

---

### Requirement 1 — Forbid the robot call for jobs with 2+ technicians

**FR-1.1:** When a `part_arrived_call` task's job has **2 or more** `assigned_techs`, the 🤖 "Let the robot call" path MUST NOT queue an outbound attempt.
**FR-1.2 (modal surface):** Clicking 🤖 on such a job opens the `RobotCallSlotModal` wrapper, which — after `getJob` returns the job — detects `assigned_techs.length >= 2` and renders a clear human message ("This job has multiple technicians — the robot call isn't available; please call manually") **instead of** the `CustomTimeModal` slot picker. No queue is possible from this state.
**FR-1.3 (server surface, non-bypassable):** `partsCallService.startRobotCall`, after loading the company-scoped job, rejects a 2+ tech job with `{ ok:false, reason:'multi_tech' }` **before** any enqueue, even if the client is bypassed. The task is left open (not stamped failed) so the dispatcher can use 📞 manual.
**FR-1.4:** Applies identically on both surfaces that mount `TaskActionButtons` → `RobotCallSlotModal` (Job card `TaskCard` + Pulse "Action Required" banner).

**AC-1.1:** A part-arrived job with ≥2 `assigned_techs`: 🤖 opens the modal showing the multi-tech message (no picker, no CTA) on both surfaces.
**AC-1.2:** A direct `POST /api/tasks/:id/actions/robot_call` (with or without a `slot`) for a ≥2-tech job returns a 200 domain refusal `reason:'multi_tech'`; **no** `outbound_call_attempts` row is inserted; the task stays open/unstamped.
**AC-1.3:** A single-tech (or zero-tech) job is unaffected — the picker renders and queuing works as SLOTPICK-001.

### Requirement 2 — The robot offers windows ONLY from the technician the dispatcher picked

**FR-2.1:** In the robot-call slot modal the dispatcher may pick a window on **ANY** technician's timeline lane (not necessarily the repair tech). The picked lane's `techId` (already emitted by `CustomTimeModal.onConfirm({…techId})`) is the chosen technician.
**FR-2.2:** That `techId` MUST be threaded end-to-end so the **in-call** `recommendSlots` is constrained to exactly that technician: modal → POST body `slot.techId` → `startRobotCall`/`buildRobotCallSlot` → `outbound_call_attempts.slot_json.techId` → worker → `placeCall` `assistantOverrides.variableValues.technicianId` → `recommendSlots` input (server-injected, model-untrusted).
**FR-2.3:** When constrained, every window the robot offers on the call (opening slot and any in-call alternative) belongs to that one technician; no other technician's availability is offered.
**FR-2.4 (fallback):** If a robot-call slot somehow carries no `techId` (should not happen — req 1 blocks 2+ tech jobs and the modal always yields a lane pick), the constraint falls back to the job's single assigned technician; absent even that, `recommendSlots` behaves as legacy (all-tech).

**AC-2.1:** Picking a window on technician B's lane (even if the job's repair tech is A) queues an attempt whose `slot_json.techId = B`; the placed call's `variableValues.technicianId = B`.
**AC-2.2:** An in-call `recommendSlots` invocation with `technicianId=B` returns only windows feasible for B (verified: the backend proxy sends a one-element `technicians` array).
**AC-2.3:** No `technicianId` → legacy all-tech recommendations (backward-compat).

### Requirement 3 — Desktop reschedule recommendations scoped to the job's current technician

**FR-3.1:** When `CustomTimeModal` is opened to **reschedule an existing job** (`JobInfoSections`, `initialSlot` present), the ranked recommendations default to the job's **current** technician. For a 2+ tech job that technician is `assigned_techs[0]` under a **deterministic stable (by-id) ordering**.
**FR-3.2:** The technician **timelines still show ALL technicians** (`buildTechGroups` unchanged) so the dispatcher can override by clicking a different lane (feeds req 2's pick).
**FR-3.3:** The reschedule is **time-only**: `assigned_techs` is NOT modified (both techs stay assigned). Already true — `scheduleService.rescheduleItem` never writes assignment; this feature does not change that.
**FR-3.4:** The **new-job** flows (`ConvertToJobSteps`, `WizardStep3`, `NewJobDialog`) are unaffected — they pass no tech constraint → all-tech recommendations as today.

**AC-3.1:** Rescheduling a single-tech job requests recommendations scoped to that tech (`new_job.technician_id` set) — recs come back only for that tech; timelines still render all techs.
**AC-3.2:** Rescheduling a 2+ tech job scopes recs to the stable-sorted `assigned_techs[0]`; after saving, the job still has BOTH techs assigned (assignment unchanged).
**AC-3.3:** New-job flows are byte-identical (no `technician_id` sent).

### Requirement 4 — In-call: customer asks a SPECIFIC DAY → offer that tech's windows on that day

**FR-4.1:** The outbound `recommendSlots` tool accepts an optional `targetDay` (`YYYY-MM-DD`). When present, recommendations are constrained to that single day (backend sets `earliest_allowed_date = latest_allowed_date = targetDay`) for the constrained technician.
**FR-4.2:** The robot offers up to `MAX_SLOTS` (3) available windows on that day for that technician; if none are available that day, it degrades to the existing safe-fallback (no fabricated window).

**AC-4.1:** `recommendSlots({ technicianId:B, targetDay:'2026-07-16' })` returns only 2026-07-16 windows feasible for B (≤3), engine-ranked.
**AC-4.2:** No feasible window that day → `{ available:false, fallback:true }` (call continues; robot says none available and offers to check another day).

### Requirement 5 — In-call: customer asks a SPECIFIC DAY + TIME → the single nearest available window

**FR-5.1:** The outbound `recommendSlots` tool accepts an optional `targetTime` (`HH:MM`, 24h), meaningful only together with `targetDay`. When present, the skill re-ranks that day's windows for the technician by proximity of the window start to `targetTime` and returns **exactly ONE** window — the nearest.
**FR-5.2:** "Nearest" = prefer the window whose `[start,end)` contains `targetTime` (an exact hit, distance 0); otherwise the window minimizing `|window_start − targetTime|`; ties break to the earlier start.
**FR-5.3:** If the requested window is free, that window is the nearest (returned as the single offer); if busy, the single nearest available window is offered.
**FR-5.4:** No engine algorithm change — the engine has no target-time concept (`slot-engine/src/engine.js:312` scores "sooner", not "nearest to T"); the nearest re-rank happens IN THE SKILL over the (≤5) same-day windows the engine returns.

**AC-5.1:** `recommendSlots({ technicianId:B, targetDay:D, targetTime:'14:30' })` with a free 14:00–16:00 window → returns exactly that one window.
**AC-5.2:** Same call when 14:00–16:00 is occupied but 16:00–18:00 is free → returns exactly the 16:00–18:00 window (single nearest).
**AC-5.3:** Exactly one slot is returned (never a list) whenever `targetTime` is present.

---

**Constraints / non-functional:**
- **NO new migration.** The chosen technician is stored in the existing freeform `outbound_call_attempts.slot_json` (`slot_json.techId`; the job's coords ride the same channel as `slot_json.lat`/`lng` so the in-call `recommendSlots` has a server-injected location). `slot_json` is copied forward on retry → the constraint persists across retries.
- **NO slot-engine (`slot-engine/src/*`) code change** — single-tech = one-element `technicians` array; day = `earliest=latest=targetDay`; nearest-to-time = re-rank in the skill. The only engine-shaping is in the backend proxy `slotEngineService` (a one-tech filter + a query-scoped ranking-cap widen so the engine returns that tech's full same-day window set rather than the default per-tech cap of 2).
- **NO change** to the schedule recs route contract (it already passes `req.body` through and is company-scoped via `req.companyFilter.company_id`), the task-action execute route / registry (the `slot` object is threaded opaquely — `techId` rides along), the outbound worker lifecycle, `CustomTimeModal` layout / `onConfirm` payload / `disabled` guard, or the SLOTPICK auto-compute / ISO→`slot_json` path.
- The chosen `technicianId` is **server-injected** (`variableValues`), never a model claim; `targetDay`/`targetTime` are the only model-fillable additions (VAPI tool-schema PATCH on the OUTBOUND assistant). Company-scoped on every query.
- English UI; existing modal styles/tokens; `npm run build` (tsc -b) + backend jest green.

**Potentially involved modules:** backend `services/slotEngineService.js` (optional `technician_id` filter + ranking-cap widen), `services/agentSkills/skills/recommendSlots.js` (new `technicianId`/`targetDay`/`targetTime` args + single-nearest re-rank), `services/partsCallService.js` (`multi_tech` gate + `techId`/coords into `slot_json`), `services/outboundCallService.js` (`technicianId`/coords into `variableValues`); frontend `components/tasks/RobotCallSlotModal.tsx` (multi-tech message + capture `techId`), `components/conversations/CustomTimeModal.tsx` + `services/slotRecommendationsApi.ts` (optional `recommendTechId`→`technician_id`), `components/jobs/JobInfoSections.tsx` (pass `recommendTechId = assigned_techs[0]`). External: the OUTBOUND VAPI assistant (`VAPI_OUTBOUND_ASSISTANT_ID`) `recommendSlots` tool param schema (PATCH: `targetDay`,`targetTime`).

**Affected integrations:** Albusto slot engine (read-only, via the existing proxy — input-shaping only); VAPI (outbound assistant tool-schema PATCH + injected `variableValues`); ZenBooker/Twilio only via the already-shipped robot-call lifecycle (unchanged).

**Protected parts (must not break):** `slot-engine/src/*` (NO change); the schedule recs route + `fetchSlotRecommendations` request/response contract (additive `technician_id` field only); `CustomTimeModal` layout / recs fetch shape / `onConfirm` payload / `disabled` guard / `buildTechGroups` (all-tech timelines); the task-action execute route envelope + `registry` contract (slot threaded opaquely); the outbound worker + `slot_json` copy-forward; `scheduleService.rescheduleItem` (time-only, never reassigns); the SLOTPICK auto-compute + `buildRobotCallSlot` ISO→`slot_json` validation; `outbound_call_attempts` schema (NO new migration); `authedFetch.ts` / `useRealtimeEvents.ts`.

## OUTBOUND-CALL-TIMELINE-001 — outbound robot calls appear in the Pulse timeline like softphone calls (live row + recording/transcript/summary) (2026-07-09)

**Relationship:** extends OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-001 (and its -BTN/-SLOTPICK/-TECHSLOT follow-ups). Today a robot call leaves NOTHING in the customer's timeline: VAPI originates its own Twilio leg with its own statusCallback (`outboundCallService.js`), our Twilio webhooks never fire, and `vapiCallStatus.js` updates only `outbound_call_attempts` + job notes. Enhancement of the write path only — the Pulse read/render pipeline (sidebar lateral, thread feed, SSE, pills, player, summary) already exists and is REUSED unchanged.

**Краткое описание:** the moment the worker places a VAPI robot call, a live `calls` row appears in the customer's Pulse timeline (softphone gold model, `routes/voice.js:344-385`); the VAPI end-of-call webhook finalizes it with status/duration and attaches the VAPI transcript (transcripts row), the VAPI summary (`transcripts.raw_payload.gemini_summary` — renders for free) and the VAPI recording (recordings row + extended playback proxy). The call is marked as AI (`calls.answered_by='ai'`, same marker family the UI already renders for inbound Sara).

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. Dispatcher fires 🤖 "Let the robot call" → within seconds the customer's Pulse thread shows an outbound call tile "Ringing" with the Bot marker; the sidebar reorders live.
2. The customer talks to the robot and books → the tile flips to Completed with duration; expanding it plays the recording and shows the AI summary + transcript.
3. Customer doesn't pick up / voicemail → the tile finalizes as No Answer / Voicemail; each retry attempt later appears as its OWN tile (like repeated softphone attempts).
4. Dispatcher opens the contact during a live robot call → the Call button is blocked ("Someone is already on a call") exactly as during a live softphone call.
5. VAPI's end-of-call webhook is lost → the row still finalizes (Twilio reconcile after re-key; hard 15-min sweeper otherwise) — no eternally-"live" threads.

**FRs:**
- **FR-1 (placement row):** after `placeCall` succeeds and `vapi_call_id` is stamped (`outboundCallWorker.js:266-276`), upsert a parent `calls` row: `status='initiated'`, `is_final=false`, `direction='outbound'`, from=robot caller-ID, to=dialed number, `company_id`/timeline from the attempt (`findOrCreateTimeline(phone, company_id)`), + SSE `call.updated`. Failure is NON-FATAL (never blocks the dial).
- **FR-2 (sid):** `call_sid` = real Twilio CallSid of VAPI's leg (`phoneCallProviderId`) when known; synthetic `vapi:<vapiCallId>` fallback at placement; re-key/merge to the real sid as soon as it is learned (status-update or end-of-call). Exact algorithm in spec S4 (handles the coldReconcile duplicate window; `ON CONFLICT (call_sid)` stays the dedup key).
- **FR-3 (AI marker):** `calls.answered_by='ai'` (mig 016 column). VERIFIED: inbound Sara rows get `answered_by` = SIP username via child-leg propagation (`inboxWorker.js:436-448`) and the UI already renders a Bot icon when `answered_by` contains `ai|vapi|bot|assistant` (`PulseContactItem.tsx:46,74-77,183`) — reuse the same column/markers, no new mechanism.
- **FR-4 (finalize):** on `end-of-call-report` (after the existing correlation, company from the attempt row — NEVER the body), map `endedReason`→calls.status (voicemail_left / no-answer / busy / completed-if-duration / failed), set started/ended/duration from the payload, `is_final=true`, + SSE. Independent of and non-disruptive to the OPC1 retry state machine.
- **FR-5 (transcript+summary):** VAPI transcript → transcripts row (synthetic `transcription_sid='vapi_<vapiCallId>'`, precedent `aai_<jobId>` in `transcriptionService.js:180`); VAPI summary → `raw_payload.gemini_summary` (renders via `formatCall`, `pulse.js:388-397`).
- **FR-6 (recording):** VAPI `recordingUrl` → recordings row (synthetic `recording_sid='vapi_<vapiCallId>'`, `source='vapi'`); extend `GET /api/calls/:callSid/recording.mp3` (`calls.js:526-567`) to stream `recordings.recording_url` when the sid is not a Twilio `RE…` sid.
- **FR-7 (live transitions, cheap):** handle VAPI `status-update` messages at the already-receiving `/api/vapi/call-status` (today dropped at `:114`): map queued/ringing/in-progress onto the row + early re-key. Requires adding `status-update` to the OUTBOUND assistant's serverMessages (ops); degrades silently without it.
- **FR-8 (reconciler safety):** Twilio pollers must never see synthetic sids: `call_sid LIKE 'CA%'` guard in `reconcileStale.js` and `getNonFinalCalls` (без него `reconcileStaleCalls` — every 5 min, 3-min threshold — 404s on `vapi:` sids and would mark a LIVE robot call `failed` mid-call, `reconcileStale.js:185-191`). Plus a 15-min sweeper finalizing orphaned non-final `vapi:%` rows as `failed`.
- **FR-9 (no backfill):** historical attempts are NOT backfilled; only calls placed after deploy get rows.

**ACs:**
- **AC-1:** worker places a call → within one SSE round-trip the thread feed shows a non-final outbound tile (pill Ringing) and the sidebar shows the Bot marker; `hasActiveCall` blocks the Call button.
- **AC-2:** end-of-call `customer-ended-call` with `durationSeconds=95`, summary, transcript, recordingUrl → row `completed`/95s/final; transcripts row with `gemini_summary`; recordings row; player streams via the proxy; SSE fired.
- **AC-3:** `customer-did-not-answer` → `no-answer`; `voicemail` → `voicemail_left`; `customer-busy` → `busy`; zero-duration pipeline error → `failed`. Attempt retry/exhaust behavior byte-identical to before.
- **AC-4:** `phoneCallProviderId` learned at finalize when a coldReconcile-created row for the same real sid already exists → ONE merged row remains (timeline/company/answered_by preserved), synthetic row deleted, no unique-violation escape.
- **AC-5:** placement-hook DB failure → call still dials; webhook finalize-hook failure → webhook still 200 and retry insert still happens (jest-proven).
- **AC-6:** `reconcileStaleCalls` never Twilio-fetches a `vapi:%` sid; a non-final `vapi:%` row older than 15 min is finalized `failed` + SSE; `CA…` rows behave exactly as today.
- **AC-7:** 3 retry attempts → 3 distinct rows/tiles, one per attempt.
- **AC-8:** recording proxy: `RE…` sid → Twilio REST path unchanged; `vapi_…` sid → streams `recording_url`; neither → 404. Route stays behind `authenticate, requireCompanyAccess`.
- **AC-9:** company isolation: all writes carry the attempt row's `company_id`; a foreign/unknown `call.id` webhook remains a 200 no-op; timeline resolution is company-scoped.
- **AC-10:** inbound Sara flow (dial, rows, recording, AssemblyAI transcript, marker) unchanged; `npm run build` + backend jest green.

**Ограничения и нефункциональные требования:**
- **NO migration** — `calls.answered_by` (mig 016), `calls.timeline_id` (mig 028), `recordings.recording_url`, `transcripts.raw_payload` all exist; synthetic sids fit `VARCHAR(100)`.
- NO new SSE event names (LEADS-NEW-BADGE gotcha avoided) — reuse `call.updated` already in `sseManager.ts` namedEvents.
- NO change to the OPC1 retry state machine, `classifyEndedReason` semantics, booked/declined/exhaust branches, or job-note texts.
- Never write recordings/transcripts under a synthetic sid before re-key (FK `REFERENCES calls(call_sid)` would block the re-key UPDATE).
- Zero required frontend changes (rendering verified end-to-end); optional P2: AI chip in the thread-feed tile (`PulseCallListItem`) reusing the sidebar's marker logic.

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули:** backend `services/vapiCallTimelineService.js` (NEW — the only new file), `services/outboundCallWorker.js` (placement hook), `routes/vapiCallStatus.js` (status-update branch + finalize call), `services/reconcileStale.js` + `db/callsQueries.js` (CA-guard + sweeper), `routes/calls.js` (proxy branch); frontend (optional) `components/pulse/PulseCallListItem.tsx` + `pulseHelpers.ts`. External: OUTBOUND VAPI assistant serverMessages (`voice-agent/assistants/parts-visit-scheduler.json` + live PATCH).

**Затронутые интеграции:** VAPI (payload fields already sent, currently discarded; serverMessages config), Twilio (read-only reconcile of the re-keyed leg). Zenbooker/Front — нет.

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):** `inboxWorker.processVoiceEvent`/`upsertCall` conflict semantics (`callsQueries.js:15-63` — extend call sites only, not the query); softphone path `routes/voice.js:344-385`; Sara inbound `callFlowRuntime.renderVapiNode`; OPC1 webhook auth + anti-spoof + idempotence (`vapiCallStatus.js:51-63,106-144`); `outbound_call_attempts` schema/state machine; `authedFetch.ts`; `useRealtimeEvents.ts`; `src/server.js` core (no new mounts needed).
## GMAIL-PUSH-FIX-001 — Restore real-time Gmail push ingest (single email in seconds, not ~10 min) (2026-07-10)

**Status:** Requirements (Product/Agent-01). Backend-only **bug fix** that REPAIRS the push path of **EMAIL-TIMELINE-001** (§ line 1955, "near real-time Gmail `users.watch` → Pub/Sub push"). Dedup checked: `grep -i gmail-push docs/requirements.md` = none. Owner-approved brief, confirmed on prod 2026-07-10. **NO migration; NO Google Cloud / Pub/Sub / topic / subscription / OIDC / DNS / Caddy change** — `gmail-inbound-push` sub, `gmail-inbound` topic, push endpoint + token are all verified correct. Bug is 100% app code.

**Краткое описание:** Push is wired end-to-end but silently ingests almost nothing — a single inbound email is never pulled by the push and waits for the fallback poll (measured 571s). Fix three app-code bugs so a single inbound email is pulled, hydrated, and linked onto the timeline within seconds.

**Root cause (verified in code):**
- **Bug 1 (primary):** `GmailProvider.handlePushNotification` (`backend/src/services/mail/GmailProvider.js:141-144`) returns `cursor` = the historyId FROM THE PUSH; `ingestPushNotification` (`services/email/emailTimelineService.js:430-431`) feeds it to `pullChangesNormalized` (`emailSyncService.js:436,449`) as `history.list(startHistoryId=…)`. Gmail's pushed historyId already INCLUDES the triggering message → the list returns only changes strictly AFTER it → EMPTY for a single email → message never pulled; the fresh cursor (line 495) is discarded (push path advances no checkpoint — comment 374-375). Only multi-email bursts partially ingest.
- **Bug 2:** `listDueMailboxes` (`db/emailQueries.js:387-388`) hardcodes `AND (last_sync_started_at IS NULL OR last_sync_started_at < now() - interval '10 minutes')` → a mailbox is "due" only every 10 min regardless of whether the prior sync FINISHED; the 60s tick (`EMAIL_SYNC_INTERVAL_MS=60000`) is effectively ~10 min.
- **Bug 3:** a SUCCESSFUL push is logged nowhere (`ingestPushNotification` returns `{handled:true}` silently; route fast-acks silently) — caused a false diagnosis 2026-07-06.

**Функциональные требования:**
- **GMAIL-PUSH-FIX-001-R1 (push lists from the STORED checkpoint):** the push ingest MUST walk history from the mailbox's stored checkpoint, not the push notification's historyId, so a single inbound email is pulled, hydrated into the inbox, AND linked onto the timeline on the push. Architect picks the design — **A:** `handlePushNotification` returns `cursor:null` so `pullChangesNormalized` falls back to `mailboxData.history_id`; or **B (leaned):** `ingestPushNotification` reuses the verified poll path `syncMailbox`→`syncIncrementalHistory` + the `ingestPolledForCompany` link pass. Either way: preserve idempotency, 404→backfill self-heal, company_id scoping, fast-ack 200.
- **GMAIL-PUSH-FIX-001-R2 (poll cadence honors the interval):** repair `listDueMailboxes` so a mailbox becomes due per `EMAIL_SYNC_INTERVAL_MS` (the `last_sync_finished_at` guard) while a genuinely in-flight, not-stuck sync is NOT re-entered; keep the 10-min bound ONLY as a stuck-sync escape hatch (a started-but-never-finished sync must not wedge a mailbox forever).
- **GMAIL-PUSH-FIX-001-R3 (observability):** emit exactly one success log line in `ingestPushNotification` when a push is handled (company + processed/linked counts), so a working push is visible in logs.

**Нефункциональные требования / критерии успеха:**
- **GMAIL-PUSH-FIX-001-N1 (latency — THE success criterion):** a single inbound email is ingested **and** linked within **~15s** of the Gmail push (target: seconds), replacing the observed 571s poll wait; the poll stays a correctness backstop only.
- **GMAIL-PUSH-FIX-001-N2 (no regressions):** push verification (`verifyPush` token + OIDC audience) unchanged and NOT weakened; fast-ack 200 + safe-fail (never throw back to Pub/Sub) preserved; idempotent (a re-delivered push must not double-post); 404 history-gap self-heal preserved; outbound sends stay linked at send time.
- **GMAIL-PUSH-FIX-001-N3:** backend `jest` green; the standalone `/email` inbox and EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 send/sync/OAuth paths unchanged beyond the checkpoint-cursor fix.

**Out of scope:** no DB migration; no GCP/Pub/Sub/topic/subscription/OIDC/DNS/Caddy change; no frontend; do NOT change `EMAIL_SYNC_INTERVAL_MS`; do NOT touch the mail-agent / MAIL-LOCAL-LLM email-triage classifier; no rework of Gmail OAuth, token refresh, `users.watch`, or the `email_*` schema.

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули:** `services/mail/GmailProvider.js` (push cursor), `services/email/emailTimelineService.js` (`ingestPushNotification` + success log), `services/emailSyncService.js` (`pullChangesNormalized` / `syncMailbox` reuse per design), `db/emailQueries.js` (`listDueMailboxes` guard), `routes/emailPush.js` (verify/fast-ack — read-only, do not weaken).

**Затронутые интеграции:** Google / Gmail — API-surface unchanged; Pub/Sub push infra unchanged (app-side cursor + poll cadence only). Twilio / Front / Zenbooker / Stripe — untouched.

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):** `emailPush.js` `verifyPush` (token + OIDC) and fast-ack 200; `syncIncrementalHistory` inbox-checkpoint advance (`email_sync_state.last_history_id` + `email_mailboxes.history_id`); 404→backfill self-heal; outbound linking at send time; MAIL-LOCAL-LLM / mail-agent classifier; EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 projection + standalone `/email` inbox.

## Фича OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-CANCEL-001: отмена запланированного робо-звонка при выходе job из «Part arrived» или при живом контакте с клиентом

**Краткое описание:** Очередь исходящего робо-звонка (part-arrived scheduling, `outbound_call_attempts`) должна жить ТОЛЬКО пока job в статусе `Part arrived`. Две причины отмены: (1) job покинул `Part arrived` любым путём; (2) состоялся успешный ЖИВОЙ разговор с клиентом (входящий или исходящий, человеком — не роботом и не Sara). Каждая отмена пишет заметку на job (почему) и штампует состояние `robot_call`-кнопки на задаче.

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. Диспетчер перевёл job из `Part arrived` в `Rescheduled` (или любой другой статус, вкл. Canceled через FSM/side-door) → очереди робо-звонка по этому job отменяются, на job появляется заметка «robot call canceled — job left 'Part arrived' (status changed to 'Rescheduled')», кнопка 🤖 на задаче показывает причину отмены.
2. Клиент сам позвонил и поговорил с диспетчером (completed, длительность > 0, трубку взял человек) → запланированный робо-звонок этому клиенту отменяется + заметка «customer was already reached by phone (inbound call …)».
3. Диспетчер сам дозвонился клиенту (исходящий звонок из софтфона, completed, длительность > 0) → то же самое (outbound call …).
4. Клиент позвонил и попал на голосовую почту / не дозвонился / поговорил только с Sara (AI) → отмены НЕТ (живого контакта не было).
5. Робот сам звонил (его звонок виден в timeline как звонок с `answered_by='ai'`) → его собственный звонок НИКОГДА не отменяет его же план.
6. После отмены диспетчер снова нажимает 🤖 → новая очередь стартует штатно (отмена не блокирует re-queue); штамп «canceled» на кнопке сбрасывается.
7. Если робо-звонок был «в проводе» (`dialing`) в момент отмены — разговор не обрывается; но неудачный исход этого звонка НЕ воскрешает цепочку ретраев (guard на insert ретрая в webhook).

**Функциональные требования:**
- FR-1 (status-cancel): при переходе job ИЗ `Part arrived` в любой другой blanc_status (manual PATCH `jobs.js:281`, FSM `/apply` `fsm.js:276-278`, `jobs.js:851` On-the-way, cancel `jobs.js:560`, complete `jobs.js:607`) все `pending`-строки `outbound_call_attempts` этого job переводятся в `status='canceled'` (+reason). Каналы, минующие `updateBlancStatus`: `cancelJob` и `markComplete` (пишут blanc_status напрямую, `jobsService.js:1298,1355`) хукуются отдельно. ZB-sync (`syncFromZenbooker`) НЕ может вывести job из `Part arrived` (не-`autoStatuses` сохраняются, `jobsService.js:1105-1120`), но МОЖЕТ выставить `zb_canceled=true` — этот флип для `Part arrived`-job тоже отменяет план.
- FR-2 (human-contact-cancel): после ФИНАЛЬНОГО upsert звонка (`inboxWorker.processVoiceEvent` → `queries.upsertCall`) с `status='completed'`, `is_final=true`, `parent_call_sid IS NULL`, `duration_sec > 0`, `answered_at IS NOT NULL`, `direction IN ('inbound','outbound')` — отменить активные attempts той же компании, сматченные по `contact_id` ИЛИ по последним 10 цифрам телефона внешней стороны (inbound → `from_number`, outbound → `to_number`). Исключения (НЕ отменяют): `call_sid LIKE 'vapi:%'`, `answered_by='ai'` (робот), звонок, чей call-flow execution завершился на узле `vapi_agent` (Sara), `no-answer`/`busy`/`failed`/`voicemail_left` (не completed), `voicemail_recording` (не final), IVR-hangup (нет `answered_at`).
- FR-3 (note): каждая отмена пишет РОВНО ОДНУ заметку на job (автор 'AI Phone', как `vapiCallStatus.js:117-122`). Копирайт (EN, точный):
  - статус: `AI: robot call canceled — job left 'Part arrived' (status changed to '<newStatus>').`
  - живой контакт: `AI: robot call canceled — customer was already reached by phone (<inbound|outbound> call completed at <ISO-time>).`
  - если в момент отмены существовала `dialing`-строка, к заметке добавляется: ` A call already in progress will not be retried.`
- FR-4 (no-resurrection): guard на insert ретрая в `vapiCallStatus.js` (transient-ветка :289-315) и в `outboundCallWorker.scheduleRetryOrExhaust` (:325-340): ретрай НЕ вставляется, если (а) company-scoped re-read job даёт `!job || zb_canceled || blanc_status !== 'Part arrived'`, ИЛИ (б) существует строка `status='canceled'` этого job с `id >` id провалившегося attempt. Exhausted-маркер и его заметка в этом случае тоже пропускаются.
- FR-5 (task stamp): отмена штампует `robot_call`-action задачи `state:'canceled'` + короткий `reason` (расширение прецедента `markRobotCallFailed`, `partsCallService.js:146-165`). Успешный `startRobotCall` (включая `already:true`) сбрасывает штамп в `state:'queued'` — re-queue после отмены работает.
- FR-6 (idempotence): повторный финальный webhook того же звонка / повторная смена статуса не находят активных attempts → no-op, ни второй заметки, ни второго штампа.
- FR-7 (изоляция): все SELECT/UPDATE/INSERT фильтруются по `company_id`; телефонный матч не пересекает границы компании.
- FR-8 (dialing не убиваем): `dialing`-строка НЕ terminate'ится отменой (звонок уже идёт); отмена лишь ставит canceled-маркер для FR-4.
- FR-9 (без миграции): у `outbound_call_attempts.status` НЕТ CHECK-констрейнта (mig 158 — plain TEXT; `canceled` уже задокументирован в COMMENT). Частичный unique-индекс покрывает только `pending|dialing` → `canceled` безопасен. Миграция 161 НЕ нужна.

**Ограничения и нефункциональные требования:**
- Все хуки fire-and-forget + safe-fail (как `onPartArrived`-хук, `jobsService.js:976-984`): сбой отмены никогда не ломает смену статуса, webhook (200) или inbox-worker.
- Матч по телефону — только полные последние 10 цифр (E164-normalized), минимум 7 цифр; anonymous-звонки без цифр — no-op.
- AMD-ограничение принято: исходящий звонок, на который ответил автоответчик, Twilio классифицирует `completed` (без AMD) — считается контактом (следуем классификации Twilio, как сформулировал владелец).

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули:** backend `services/partsCallService.js` (cancel-сервис + штампы), `services/jobsService.js` (leave-хуки), `services/inboxWorker.js` (post-final-upsert хук), `routes/vapiCallStatus.js` + `services/outboundCallWorker.js` (retry-guard, честный `canceled` в Guard-1), frontend `components/tasks/tasksApi.ts` + `components/tasks/TaskActionButtons.tsx` (рендер `state:'canceled'`).

**Затронутые интеграции:** Twilio (только чтение уже приходящих статусов), VAPI (только guard в существующем webhook). Zenbooker — только чтение флипа `zb_canceled` в существующем sync. Новых внешних вызовов нет.

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):**
- `callsQueries.upsertCall` SQL (:15-63) — хук ставится ПОСЛЕ вызова, сам запрос не трогать.
- FSM-валидация `updateBlancStatus` (:893-927) и ZB-sync матрица (:942-969) — хук строго после UPDATE, не в транзакции с ним.
- Anti-spoof/idempotence webhook (`vapiCallStatus.js:125-224`), партиальный unique-индекс mig 158, claim-loop `outboundCallWorker.tick`.
- `onPartArrived` / `startRobotCall` семантика (SLOTPICK/TECHSLOT ветки) — только добавка `queued`-штампа на успех.
- `inboxWorker` guards (skipUpsert/voicemail-preserve :283-341) — не менять, хук читает их РЕЗУЛЬТАТ.

## REPAIR-ADVISOR-001 — AI Repair Advisor (marketplace)

**Status:** Requirements
**Priority:** P1
**Owner:** CRM / Integrations
**Stage:** 1 (of a phased rollout — Stage 2 items listed under Non-goals)

### 1. Purpose

Add a marketplace app **"AI Repair Advisor"** (app key `ai-repair-advisor`) to Albusto CRM. A company connects/disconnects it in **Settings → Integrations** using the existing marketplace lifecycle. Once connected for a company, whenever a job is **created via a human path** the system asynchronously (best-effort) sends the job's problem text to the **KB knowledge-base RAG service** and appends **exactly ONE diagnostic note** to that job. The note gives the technician an evidence-grounded head start: probable causes, diagnosis steps, and how to enter the appliance model's diagnostic mode (when the manual documents one).

Human paths in Stage 1 = **manual job creation** (`POST /api/jobs` → `createDirectJob`) and **lead→job conversion** (`convertLead`). The note is authored by `AI Repair Advisor` with `created_by='system'`, so it renders automatically in the job card and is non-editable by regular users.

This is a **new feature**. It reuses the marketplace canon (F016/F018) and the `jobsService.addNote` seam; it introduces one new outbound integration client (`ragClient.js`) modeled on `zenbookerClient.js`. No frontend work is required — the marketplace tile and its connect/disconnect UI render automatically from the seed.

### 2. User roles & permissions

- **tenant_admin** (or any role holding `tenant.integrations.manage`) — connects/disconnects the app in Settings → Integrations. This is the only user-facing action.
- **Dispatcher / technician / provider** — consume the resulting note in the job card (read-only; the note is `created_by='system'`). No new permission is granted to them.
- The diagnostic note generation is a **system action** (no interactive user). It runs under the company context captured at job-creation time.

### 3. Use cases

#### UC-01: Connect the app
tenant_admin opens Settings → Integrations → sees the "AI Repair Advisor" tile (rendered from the seed) with status "Available" → clicks Connect → marketplace installation status becomes `connected`. From now on, human-path job creation for this company triggers diagnostic notes.

#### UC-02: Disconnect the app
tenant_admin disconnects the app in Settings → Integrations → installation leaves `connected`. Subsequent job creations produce **no** diagnostic note. Existing notes on past jobs are untouched.

#### UC-03: Job created manually → note appears
App is connected. A user creates a job via `POST /api/jobs` (`createDirectJob`) with a problem description. Job creation returns success immediately. Asynchronously, the advisor queries the RAG service and appends **one** note (three sections) authored "AI Repair Advisor" to the job. The note appears in the job card.

#### UC-04: Job created via lead conversion → note appears
App is connected. A lead is converted to a job via `convertLead`. Same behavior as UC-03: one advisor note is appended to the resulting job.

#### UC-05: App NOT connected → no note
App is not connected (or disconnected) for the company. A job is created via a human path. **No** RAG call is made and **no** note is appended. Job creation is unaffected.

#### UC-06: RAG service down → no note, job unaffected
App is connected, but the RAG service is unreachable / times out / returns a non-2xx (e.g. current public tunnel 502). Job creation **succeeds normally**; the advisor swallows the error (logged), appends **no** note. The user sees no failure and no partial/error note.

#### UC-07: Job with no / thin description → graceful attempt
App is connected; the job has an empty or very thin description. The advisor still attempts with whatever text is available (`description`, falling back to `comments`, plus `job_type`/`service_name`). If the RAG returns nothing useful, the advisor degrades gracefully — it either appends no note or a note containing only the sections it could ground — and never crashes or writes a malformed note.

### 4. Functional requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-01 | Seed migration registers app `ai-repair-advisor` in `marketplace_apps` (catalog); the migration is added to `marketplaceQueries.ensureMarketplaceSchema()`. Connect/disconnect uses the existing `marketplace_installations` lifecycle (`status='connected'` = enabled). Tile + connect/disconnect UI render automatically (no FE work). | P0 |
| FR-02 | Runtime gate `isAppConnected(companyId, 'ai-repair-advisor')` in `backend/src/services/marketplaceService.js`, mirroring the pattern at `schedule.js:200`. | P0 |
| FR-03 | A `job.created` domain event is emitted via the eventBus at **both** human create sites — `createDirectJob` (`POST /api/jobs`) and `convertLead` — carrying at least `{ jobId, companyId }`. | P0 |
| FR-04 | A new subscriber `kb-diagnostics` in `eventSubscribers.js` handles `job.created`: it checks the gate (FR-02) and, only when connected, schedules a best-effort task with `setImmediate` (fire-and-forget, established post-job-creation pattern). | P0 |
| FR-05 | New `backend/src/services/ragClient.js` (modeled on `zenbookerClient.js`): `POST {RAG_API_URL}/ask` with body `{ question, filters: { brand, unitType } }`, bounded by `RAG_TIMEOUT_MS`. Parses response `{ summary, likely_causes:[{cause,probability}], + fenced structured JSON (diagnosis_steps / repair_instructions), confidence, grounded }`. | P0 |
| FR-06 | The `question` is built from `jobs.description` (primary), falling back to `jobs.comments`, plus job type (`jobs.job_type` / `service_name`). Optional `filters.brand` / `filters.unitType` come from `jobs.metadata` custom fields **if present**; otherwise omitted — RAG works without brand/unit filters. | P0 |
| FR-07 | On a usable RAG response, format **exactly ONE** note with **exactly THREE** sections, in order: **(a) probable causes** (each with a likelihood), **(b) diagnosis steps**, **(c) how to enter the model's diagnostic mode** — section (c) included **only if** the manual/RAG provides one. No other sections in Stage 1. | P0 |
| FR-08 | Append the note via `jobsService.addNote(jobId, text, [], 'AI Repair Advisor', 'system')` → written to `jobs.notes` JSONB, `created_by='system'` (non-editable by regular users), rendered automatically in the job card. | P0 |
| FR-09 | **Idempotency:** at most **one** advisor note per job-creation event. Redelivery/retry must not duplicate the note; failures do not retry-storm. | P0 |
| FR-10 | **Best-effort isolation from job creation:** the RAG call and note append run outside the job-creation transaction/critical path; any error (unreachable, timeout, non-2xx, parse failure) is caught and logged, and **never** propagates to fail or delay the create request. | P0 |
| FR-11 | **Company scoping:** `companyId` originates from `req.companyFilter?.company_id` at the create site and travels on the event; the gate check and every SQL read/write filters by that `company_id`. Never trust a client-supplied company id. | P0 |
| FR-12 | Configurable via env `RAG_API_URL` and `RAG_TIMEOUT_MS`. If `RAG_API_URL` is unset/blank, the advisor is inert (no calls, no notes). | P1 |

### 5. Non-goals (explicitly OUT — Stage 2 / future)

- **Additional note sections** — parts recommendations, dispatcher clarifying-questions, and safety warnings are **Stage 2** and MUST NOT appear in the Stage 1 note (three sections only).
- **Non-human trigger paths** — jobs created via the **Zenbooker webhook sync** and jobs created by the **scheduler** do **NOT** trigger the advisor in Stage 1.
- **Structured brand/model modeling** — no new brand/model columns and no NLP brand/unit extraction; only existing `jobs.metadata` custom fields are read opportunistically.
- **Re-generation / refresh** — no re-running the advisor on job edit, no manual "ask again" button, no multiple notes per job.
- **Bespoke settings UI** — beyond the auto-rendered marketplace tile (connect/disconnect); no dedicated settings page, no per-company RAG tuning.
- **Persisting raw RAG payloads, streaming, feedback loop, or analytics** on advisor quality.
- **Deployment network path** — the real Vultr→mini RAG route is decided separately at deploy time and is out of code scope (public tunnel currently 502).

### 6. Constraints & dependencies

**Security (mandatory project rules, restated):**
- Any new/changed API route: `authenticate` + `requireCompanyAccess`; `company_id` taken ONLY from `req.companyFilter?.company_id` (never from client payload).
- Every SQL filters by `company_id`; cross-tenant read/write is impossible.
- Mandatory tests: 401/403 on each new/affected endpoint + tenant-isolation tests.

**Feature constraints:**
- **RAG availability = best-effort.** Unreachable / timeout / non-2xx ⇒ no note, and job creation MUST NOT fail (UC-06). Governed by `RAG_API_URL` / `RAG_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- **Async, off the critical path.** `setImmediate` fire-and-forget after job creation; never inside the create transaction.
- **Trigger scope = human paths only** (`createDirectJob` + `convertLead`). ZB-webhook sync and scheduler-created jobs are OUT.
- **Idempotency = one advisor note per job-creation event.**
- **Note = exactly the three specified sections**, diagnostic-mode section conditional on manual availability.
- Backend is CommonJS. New marketplace seed migration — verify the actual max migration number in `backend/db/migrations` immediately before creating (parallel branches drift).
- Frontend builds with `npm run build` (tsc -b; prod Docker stricter). No FE code expected, but any incidental FE change must build clean.
- Prod deploy only on owner's explicit consent.

**Dependencies:**
- KB knowledge-base RAG service reachable at `RAG_API_URL` exposing `POST /ask`.
- Marketplace core (F016/F018): `marketplace_apps`, `marketplace_installations`, `marketplaceQueries.ensureMarketplaceSchema()`, `marketplaceService`.
- eventBus + `eventSubscribers.js`; `jobsService.addNote`.

### 7. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-01:** With the app connected, `POST /api/jobs` creating a job returns success and, within a short async window, the job carries **exactly one** note authored `AI Repair Advisor` with `created_by='system'`, non-editable by regular users, containing up to the three defined sections.
- **AC-02:** `convertLead` producing a job yields the same one-note behavior as AC-01.
- **AC-03:** When the app is NOT connected for the company, a human-path job creation produces **no** advisor note and makes **no** RAG call.
- **AC-04:** When the RAG service is unreachable / times out / returns non-2xx, the job is created successfully, **no** note is appended, the error is logged, and no failure is surfaced to the user.
- **AC-05:** A job with empty/thin description still triggers an attempt; on an unusable RAG response the outcome is graceful (no note or a note with only grounded sections) — never a crash or malformed note.
- **AC-06:** Jobs created via the Zenbooker webhook sync or by the scheduler produce **no** advisor note (out-of-scope triggers).
- **AC-07:** Idempotency — repeated delivery of a single `job.created` event does not create a second advisor note.
- **AC-08:** Company isolation — the note attaches only to the originating company's job; the RAG question is built only from that job's data; the gate check uses the event's `companyId`.
- **AC-09:** The three-section format holds: probable causes carry likelihoods; the diagnostic-mode section is **omitted** when the manual has none; no parts/dispatcher-questions/safety sections appear.
- **AC-10:** Tests cover 401/403 on any new/affected route, tenant isolation, connected-vs-not gating, the RAG-down path, and note formatting.

### 8. Potentially involved modules / parts of the system

**Backend:**
- `backend/db/migrations/<next>_seed_ai_repair_advisor_marketplace_app.sql` — seed the app into `marketplace_apps` (verify next migration number before creating).
- `backend/src/db/marketplaceQueries.js` — add the seed migration to `ensureMarketplaceSchema()`.
- `backend/src/services/marketplaceService.js` — add `isAppConnected(companyId, 'ai-repair-advisor')` gate (mirror `schedule.js:200`).
- Job create sites — `createDirectJob` (`POST /api/jobs`) and `convertLead` — emit `job.created` via the eventBus.
- `backend/src/.../eventSubscribers.js` — new `kb-diagnostics` subscriber (gate check + `setImmediate` best-effort task).
- `backend/src/services/ragClient.js` — **new** outbound client (mirror `zenbookerClient.js`); env `RAG_API_URL` / `RAG_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- `backend/src/services/jobsService.js` — reuse `addNote(jobId, text, [], 'AI Repair Advisor', 'system')` (no change to the seam).

**Frontend:**
- None expected — the marketplace tile + connect/disconnect render automatically from the seed (as in F016/F018).

### 9. Affected integrations

- **KB knowledge-base RAG** — new outbound HTTP integration (`POST {RAG_API_URL}/ask`), best-effort, config-gated.
- **Marketplace** — one new seeded app + runtime gate (reuse of existing lifecycle).
- **Zenbooker / Twilio / Front / Stripe / Google** — **not** affected (ZB-sync path is explicitly an out-of-scope trigger).

### 10. Protected parts of the code (do NOT break)

- Marketplace core: `/api/marketplace/*` lifecycle, existing seeded apps and their pages, `MarketplaceConnectDialog` (protected since F016) — extend via a new seed only.
- `jobsService.addNote` contract and the `jobs.notes` JSONB rendering in the job card — reuse as-is.
- Job creation flows `createDirectJob` and `convertLead` — additive event emission only; their existing success/latency/transaction behavior must be byte-for-byte unchanged (advisor is strictly post-commit, async, best-effort).
- Zenbooker job-sync and scheduler-created job paths — no advisor coupling (must remain note-free).
- `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`, `src/server.js` (mount-only if ever needed) — untouched.
- Existing migrations — not modified; changes only via the new seed migration.

## STRIPE-CONNECT-UX-001 — redesign of the in-app Stripe connect flow: violet-cloud banners, pricing/terms in-product, copy fixes (2026-07-10)

**Relationship:** presentation-layer follow-up to STRIPE-PAY-001 (settings page + readiness/checklist) and STRIPE-ADHOC-PAY-001 (Job → Finance CTA card). **Not a duplicate** — no existing requirement covers the *sell/onboard* surface: today the settings page has broken-english description ("Accept customer payments by Stripe"), a misleading `not_connected` badge ("Available"), env-speak ("Stripe is not configured on this environment yet…"), opens straight into "Setup checklist", and carries NO value prop, NO pricing, NO trust signals, NO time expectation; the Job Finance CTA (`JobFinancialsTab.tsx` ~128–176) is a flat gray `bg-[var(--blanc-surface-muted)]` card that reads like a disclaimer. **FRONTEND-ONLY** (plus pure label strings in the backend checklist builder). Mockups APPROVED by the owner (variant A light cloud for the job banner; light hero in Settings). **All quoted copy below is FINAL — reproduce verbatim.**

**Краткое описание:** the Stripe connect flow becomes a product surface that sells the feature: a reusable violet-"cloud" CSS pattern powers a mobile-first hero on the Settings page (value prop, 3 benefits, pricing chips, big violet "Connect Stripe" CTA, trust row) plus a hardcoded "What it costs" rate card; the Job Finance CTA becomes the same light-cloud banner; all env-speak/broken copy is fixed. Gating logic, APIs, and readiness computation are untouched — presentation only.

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. **Admin connecting from a phone:** an account admin opens Settings → Integrations → Stripe payments on a 375px phone. Above the fold she sees the cloud hero — "Get paid on the spot", the three benefits, the pricing chips, and the violet "Connect Stripe" button with "Takes about 5 minutes…" underneath. She understands what it costs (2.9% + 30¢, $0 monthly, 0% Albusto fee) and that card data never touches Albusto — and taps Connect without leaving the app to research pricing.
2. **Admin mid-onboarding:** she returns after an interrupted Stripe onboarding; the hero is replaced by a compact cloud "Almost there — finish your Stripe setup" with a [Finish setup] button; the "Setup steps" list below shows human labels ("Connect your Stripe account", "Add your business details", "Turn on card payments").
3. **Tech/dispatcher on a job (manage perm):** a user with `tenant.integrations.manage` opens a job's Finance tab in a not-connected company → sees the light-cloud banner "Get paid for this job today" with a violet [Connect Stripe] and "One-time setup · ~5 min" — same states, new presentation.
4. **Tech without manage perm:** a provider opens Finance on the same job → the same cloud banner with a lock icon and "Your company isn't set up for payments yet. Ask an account admin to connect Stripe in Settings → Integrations." — no button.
5. **Connected company:** readiness `connected_ready` → NO hero anywhere; the Settings readiness block + action buttons stay as today (one primary only); the job banner never renders (unchanged `showCta` logic).

**FRs:**

- **FR-CLOUD (reusable cloud pattern):** one shared, pure-CSS "violet cloud" surface (NO image assets): white base + layered radial-gradients + two blurred pseudo-element circles; border `1px solid rgba(127,66,225,.16)`; radius 22px. Exact background layers: `radial-gradient(58% 90% at 12% 18%, rgba(127,66,225,.16), transparent 62%), radial-gradient(48% 74% at 88% 8%, rgba(231,219,253,.95), transparent 66%), radial-gradient(70% 100% at 78% 96%, rgba(127,66,225,.12), transparent 58%), radial-gradient(36% 52% at 40% 78%, rgba(231,219,253,.7), transparent 70%), #FFFFFF`. Used by the Settings hero, the Settings partially-connected compact cloud, and all three JobFinancialsTab banner states.

- **FR-HERO (Settings not-connected hero):** on readiness `not_connected`/`disconnected`, the page opens with the cloud hero (mobile-first, content above the fold at 375px), containing verbatim:
  - eyebrow: "PAYMENTS"
  - heading: "Get paid on the spot"
  - sub: "Charge a card at the job, text a payment link, or key it in over the phone. Money lands in your bank in about 2 business days."
  - 3 benefits: "Every way to pay — Card on site, payment link by text or email" / "Fast payouts — Free, to your bank in ~2 business days" / "No monthly fees — Pay only when you get paid"
  - pricing chips: "2.9% + 30¢ per card payment" · "$0 monthly" · "0% added by Albusto"
  - big violet CTA "Connect Stripe" + micro-copy "Takes about 5 minutes. Have your business details and bank account handy."
  - trust row: lock icon + "Powered by Stripe · Card data never touches Albusto".
  Partially-connected readiness (onboarding started but not `connected_ready`): the hero is replaced by a compact cloud — "Almost there — finish your Stripe setup" + "Stripe needs a few more business details before you can take payments." + [Finish setup]. `connected_ready`: NO hero; current readiness block + post-connect buttons stay (one primary button only).

- **FR-COST (Settings "What it costs" card-table):** desktop — to the right of the hero (grid `1.15fr/.85fr`); mobile — below the hero. Rows (rates HARDCODED, no API):
  - Card payment — link or keyed-in (sub: Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Apple Pay, Google Pay) → 2.9% + 30¢
  - Tap to Pay in person (sub: on the technician's phone) → "2.7% + 5¢ · soon" (gray)
  - Monthly or setup fees → $0 (green)
  - Payouts to your bank (sub: about 2 business days) → Free (green)
  - Instant payouts — optional → 1.5%
  - Albusto fee on top → 0% (green)
  Footer: "Stripe's standard US rates, charged by Stripe. International cards +1.5%. Full details at stripe.com/pricing."

- **FR-COPY (copy fixes):**
  - Settings page description ("Accept customer payments by Stripe") → "Take card payments on the job, by link, or over the phone"
  - badge for `not_connected` ("Available") → "Not connected"
  - not-configured env copy → "Stripe isn't set up for this workspace yet. Once platform keys are added, you can connect your account here."
  - backend checklist labels (`backend/src/services/stripePaymentsService.js:67-71`, pure label strings): "Connect Stripe account" → "Connect your Stripe account"; "Complete business onboarding" → "Add your business details"; "Enable card payments" → "Turn on card payments"; the other two labels unchanged
  - checklist section title "Setup checklist" → "Setup steps"; the checklist moves BELOW the hero.

- **FR-JOB (JobFinancialsTab cloud banner, variant A):** the flat gray CTA card (~lines 128–176) becomes the light-cloud banner. Three states, gating UNCHANGED:
  - connect state (`not_connected`/`disconnected`, user has `tenant.integrations.manage`): "Get paid for this job today" · "Charge the card on the spot or text a secure payment link. No invoice needed — money hits your bank in days." · violet [Connect Stripe] + micro "One-time setup · ~5 min"
  - finish-setup state (setup-incomplete readiness, manage user): same cloud, "Almost there — finish your Stripe setup" + "Stripe needs a few more business details before you can take payments." + [Finish setup]
  - no-`tenant.integrations.manage` state: same cloud, lock icon + "Your company isn't set up for payments yet. Ask an account admin to connect Stripe in Settings → Integrations." — no button.
  The `showCta` condition, perm-gate → `can_collect` → CTA-variant branching, and navigate target stay byte-identical in behavior.

- **FR-MOBILE (mobile-first, mandatory):** hero content (eyebrow → CTA) above the fold at 375px; the hero/cost grid and pricing chips collapse to a single column on mobile; all tap targets ≥ 44px; visual verification in the browser preview at mobile 375px AND desktop widths is part of acceptance.

**ACs:**
- **AC-1:** `npm run build` (tsc -b) green (prod Docker is stricter — no unused locals).
- **AC-2:** backend jest green. NOTE: `tests/stripePayments.test.js` currently asserts readiness states only, NOT checklist label strings — verify after the label change and update assertions if any test pins the old labels.
- **AC-3:** visual verification in browser preview at 375px and desktop: hero above the fold on mobile, grids collapse, cost table readable, cloud renders correctly on both surfaces.
- **AC-4:** gating behavior identical — for every combination of (permissions × readiness × configured) the SAME states render as before the change (connect / finish-setup / no-perm / nothing / connected); only presentation and copy differ.
- **AC-5:** all copy from FR-HERO / FR-COST / FR-COPY / FR-JOB appears verbatim (character-for-character, including "·", "¢", "~", "%").
- **AC-6:** the cloud is pure CSS — zero image/SVG-file assets added for the gradient pattern.

**Ограничения и нефункциональные требования:**
- **FRONTEND-ONLY** + the pure label strings in `stripePaymentsService.js` `buildChecklist` — NO gating, API, readiness-computation, or route changes; NO migration; the invoice/estimate send-and-pay flow untouched.
- Rates are HARDCODED strings (no pricing API); "Blanc" never ships in UI — product name is Albusto.
- Design tokens only (`--blanc-accent` #7F42E1, `--blanc-accent-soft` #E7DBFD, Manrope headings) except the cloud's specified rgba layers; primary buttons stay violet; no `<hr>`/Separator.
- English UI; no new dependencies.

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули:** frontend `pages/StripePaymentsSettingsPage.tsx` (hero + cost card + copy + badge + section title/order), `components/jobs/JobFinancialsTab.tsx` (CTA card → cloud banner, presentation only), a small shared cloud style (component or CSS class — implementer's choice); backend `src/services/stripePaymentsService.js:67-71` (three label strings). Tests: `tests/stripePayments.test.js` (only if label assertions appear).

**Затронутые интеграции:** Stripe — visual/copy layer only (no API-shape change). Twilio / Front / Zenbooker / VAPI — нет.

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):** `JobFinancialsTab` gating logic (`canCollect` perm-gate, `stripeReady`, `showCta` condition, readiness→variant branching, navigate to `/settings/integrations/stripe-payments`); `stripePaymentsService.js` readiness computation (`computeReadiness`, `canCollect`, checklist `key`/`done`/`deferred` semantics — labels only); the Collect-payment button + `CollectPaymentModal` path (STRIPE-ADHOC-PAY-001); Stripe connect/onboard routes and `publicStatus` response shape; invoice-anchored collect surfaces (SEND-DOC-001); `authedFetch.ts`.

## SOFTPHONE-WARMUP-SUMMARY-001 — mobile-proof the SoftPhone warm-up modal + turn it into a "Today at a glance" day-start summary (2026-07-11)

**Relationship:** hardens **MOBILE-NO-SOFTPHONE-001** (browser softphone is DESKTOP-ONLY — this feature closes the one leak in that gate) and evolves the **intentional warm-up modal** canon (softphone-warmup-modal — the modal exists because `AudioContext` needs a user gesture; it MUST stay on desktop, only its content changes). Reuses **AR-TASK-UNIFY-001** (Action-Required = open tasks with `parent_type='timeline'`), **TASKS-COUNT-BADGE-001** (`GET /api/tasks/count`), **LEADS-NEW-BADGE-001** (`GET /api/leads/new-count`) and the Pulse unread badge (`GET /api/pulse/unread-count`). **Not a duplicate** — no existing requirement covers the warm-up modal's content or its mobile leak. Root cause (owner-confirmed): iOS PWA **standalone cold start** — `useIsMobile` (`frontend/src/hooks/useIsMobile.ts`) is width-only (`innerWidth < 768`, `useState` initializer + `resize` listener); at standalone launch the early `innerWidth` can read wrong (>768) with no `resize` event following → `isMobile=false` sticks long enough for softphone groups to load → Twilio Device registers → `deviceReady` → `showWarmUp` latched and never reset. Width-only also misses iPhone landscape (932px). Softphone files did NOT change between prod builds — not a code regression.

**Краткое описание:** (A) belt-and-suspenders mobile gate so the "SoftPhone Ready" modal is mathematically impossible on mobile (three independent belts: hardened `useIsMobile`, explicit `!isMobile` in arming AND render, reset-on-flip); (B) the desktop modal's content becomes a useful day-at-a-glance summary — three clickable stat columns (Pulse inbox / New leads / Open tasks) backed by counters AppLayout already fetches for the nav badges, with a single additive backend tweak (`parent_type` pass-through on `GET /api/tasks/count`) for the AR component of column 1. `warmUpAudio()` semantics identical — every dismiss path runs inside a user gesture.

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. **Dispatcher starting the day (desktop):** she logs in on desktop; once the Device registers, the modal appears — "Today at a glance", subtext "Enabling sound for incoming calls", three columns with live counts: Pulse inbox **7** (unread + action-required), New leads **3**, Open tasks **5**. She clicks the "New leads" column → the ringtone is enabled (warm-up ran on that click), the modal closes, and she lands on `/leads`.
2. **Dispatcher with nothing pending:** all three counts are 0; she clicks the primary button "Let's go" → audio warmed, modal dismissed, she stays where she is. Exactly today's behavior, new copy.
3. **Technician on iOS PWA (standalone cold start):** he taps the Home-Screen icon; even if the first `innerWidth` momentarily reads >768, the hardened `useIsMobile` corrects and the explicit `!isMobile` belts in arming + render + the reset-on-flip effect guarantee the modal never appears and no softphone artifacts load. Same guarantee in iPhone landscape (932px wide).
4. **Slow/failing counters (desktop):** the backend is slow or a counter request fails — the modal still appears immediately with "—" (or a skeleton) in the affected columns; clicks still navigate + warm up. Counters never delay or block the modal; errors are fail-silent.

**FRs:**

- **FR-MOBILE-FIX (belt-and-suspenders, three independent belts):**
  - **(a) harden `useIsMobile`** — replace the width-only check with a robust formula the Architect pins (options: `matchMedia('(max-width: 767px)')` with a `change` listener, OR combined with a coarse-pointer/touch heuristic such as `(pointer: coarse)`). Constraints: the hook stays a drop-in — same name/signature (optional `breakpoint` param, default 768, must keep working), same "reactive boolean" contract; **all existing consumers must keep working** (call-site audit below — all 26 call sites use the default breakpoint, none pass an argument).
  - **(b) explicit `!isMobile`** in BOTH the arming effect (`useEffect` at `AppLayout.tsx:73`: `softPhoneEnabled && voice.phoneAllowed && voice.deviceReady`) AND the Dialog `open` expression (`AppLayout.tsx:~192`: currently `showWarmUp && !location.pathname.startsWith('/schedule')` — no mobile gate today). Defense-in-depth: even though `softPhoneEnabled` already embeds `!isMobile`, the belt must not rely on that indirection.
  - **(c) reset on flip:** an effect that sets `showWarmUp` to `false` whenever `isMobile` flips to `true` — un-latches a modal armed during a transient wrong-width window.
  - **D1:** on mobile there is NO modal and NO softphone artifacts at all — nothing extra loads (the existing `softPhoneEnabled = !isMobile && …` gate on `useTwilioDevice` stays as-is).
  - **`useIsMobile` call-site audit (26 calls, all no-arg / default breakpoint):** `components/layout/AppLayout.tsx:39`, `components/softphone/ClickToCallButton.tsx:28`, `components/ui/dialog.tsx:87`, `components/ui/popover.tsx:58`, `components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx:62`, `components/ui/select.tsx:106`, `components/schedule/DayView.tsx:53`, `components/schedule/SlotContextMenu.tsx:36`, `components/tasks/TaskActionButtons.tsx:55`, `components/auth/TwoFactorGate.tsx:48`, `components/telephony/TelephonyNav.tsx:37`, `components/telephony/TelephonyLayout.tsx:18`, `components/jobs/JobTechnicianControl.tsx:37`, `hooks/useJobsData.ts:50`, `hooks/useOverlayDismiss.ts:158`, `hooks/useScheduleData.ts:79`, `pages/JobsPage.tsx:22`, `pages/LeadsPage.tsx:47`, `pages/PulsePage.tsx:54`, `pages/RolesAccessPage.tsx:336`, `pages/SchedulePage.tsx:38`, `pages/TasksPage.tsx:65`, `pages/telephony/RouteManagerOverviewPage.tsx:23`, `pages/telephony/UserGroupsPage.tsx:40` + `:107`. (Comment-only mentions, no calls: `MobileListPage.tsx`, `MobileScheduleBar.tsx`, `Leads/Jobs` mobile list/bar/card files.) Overlay-critical consumers (`dialog.tsx`, `select.tsx`, `popover.tsx`, `dropdown-menu.tsx`, `useOverlayDismiss.ts`) drive the mobile BottomSheet swap (OVERLAY-CANON-002) — the hardened hook must not change their desktop/mobile classification on real devices.

- **FR-SUMMARY (desktop day-at-a-glance modal content):**
  - The modal (same `Dialog`, same open/dismiss lifecycle) replaces its current content (Phone icon / "SoftPhone Ready" / "Enable incoming call ringtone…" / "Enable Ringtone") with: title **"Today at a glance"**, small subtext **"Enabling sound for incoming calls"**, three clickable stat columns, and primary button **"Let's go"**.
  - **Columns (D2):** (1) **"Pulse inbox"** = `pulseUnreadCount` + AR count (open tasks with `parent_type='timeline'`) → click navigates to `/pulse`; (2) **"New leads"** = `leadsNewCount` → `/leads`; (3) **"Open tasks"** = `openTasksCount` → `/tasks`.
  - **Click behavior:** column click = navigate + dismiss (`setShowWarmUp(false)`) + `warmUpAudio()` — all within the same user gesture (the gesture is what unlocks the AudioContext; it MUST be preserved on every interactive element). "Let's go" = `warmUpAudio()` + dismiss, no navigation — byte-identical semantics to today's `handleWarmUpDismiss`.
  - **Counters reuse (zero new requests except AR):** columns 2–3 reuse the existing AppLayout badge state (`pulseUnreadCount` ← `GET /api/pulse/unread-count`; `leadsNewCount` ← `GET /api/leads/new-count`; `openTasksCount` ← `GET /api/tasks/count`, role-scoped: manage = company-wide, else own). Column 1 additionally needs the AR count via `GET /api/tasks/count?parent_type=timeline` (FR-COUNT-API).
  - **D5 states:** counter still loading → "—" or skeleton in that column — the modal NEVER waits for counters; counter fetch error → fail-silent "—" (no toast, no console spam beyond existing patterns). Clicks work regardless of counter state.
  - **D1:** the summary is DESKTOP-ONLY (it lives inside the warm-up modal, which the belts make impossible on mobile).
  - **Design:** `--blanc-*` tokens only; the reusable `ui/CloudBanner` (violet cloud from STRIPE-CONNECT-UX-001) MAY back the summary surface per the owner's juicy-banner canon — Architect/implementer's call; counts large (heading font), labels as `.blanc-eyebrow`-style captions; no `<hr>`/Separator; no decorative icon soup.

- **FR-COUNT-API (additive `parent_type` pass-through):** `GET /api/tasks/count` (`backend/src/routes/tasks.js:70-80`) currently hardcodes `filters={status:'open'}` and ignores `parent_type`, though `tasksQueries` `buildConditions` already supports it (`tasksQueries.js:141` — validated via `isValidParentType`, invalid values silently ignored). Change: pass `req.query.parent_type` into `filters`. **Additive and backward-compatible:** no param → behavior byte-identical to today (nav badge unchanged); role-scoping branch (`canManage` → company-wide / else `scopeOwnerId`) untouched and applies to the filtered count too. No changes to `tasksQueries`.

- **FR-COPY (D4 — English defaults, pipeline may polish in this spirit):** title "Today at a glance"; subtext "Enabling sound for incoming calls"; column labels "Pulse inbox" / "New leads" / "Open tasks"; primary button "Let's go". "Blanc" never ships in UI (product = Albusto).

**ACs:**
- **AC-1:** the modal is mathematically impossible on mobile — three independent belts (hardened `useIsMobile`, explicit `!isMobile` in arming AND `Dialog open`, reset-on-flip effect); any single belt failing still leaves the other two blocking.
- **AC-2:** on desktop the modal shows the "Today at a glance" summary with live counts in all three columns (values match the nav badges + AR count).
- **AC-3:** clicking a column navigates to its route AND dismisses the modal AND runs `warmUpAudio()` within the click gesture; "Let's go" warms + dismisses without navigating.
- **AC-4:** `GET /api/tasks/count?parent_type=timeline` returns the open-AR count; the same call WITHOUT the param returns exactly today's number (backward-compat — nav badge unchanged); role-scoping preserved in both cases.
- **AC-5:** `npm run build` (tsc -b) green + backend jest green.
- **AC-6:** D5 states verified — counters loading show "—"/skeleton without delaying the modal; a failed counter request degrades to "—" silently.

**Ограничения и нефункциональные требования:**
- **NO migrations.** Frontend + ONE additive backend route tweak (`tasks.js` count route); no new endpoints, no SSE changes.
- `useTwilioDevice`, `SoftPhoneWidget`, presence, and the `softPhoneEnabled` computation are UNTOUCHED except the explicit belts described in FR-MOBILE-FIX.
- Nav badges (Pulse / Leads / Tasks counts in `AppNavTabs` / `BottomNavBar`) untouched — the summary only reads the same state.
- All 26 `useIsMobile` call sites must keep working (list in FR-MOBILE-FIX); the hook's public signature is preserved.
- The warm-up modal stays DELIBERATE on desktop (AudioContext user-gesture canon) — do not remove it, do not auto-dismiss without a gesture.
- English UI; design tokens only; no new dependencies.

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули:**
- `frontend/src/hooks/useIsMobile.ts` — hardened detection formula (Architect pins it).
- `frontend/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` — belts (b)/(c), modal content swap, AR-count fetch, click handlers.
- `backend/src/routes/tasks.js` — `parent_type` pass-through on `GET /count` (route layer only).
- Optionally `frontend/src/components/ui/CloudBanner.tsx` / design-system CSS — if the cloud surface backs the summary.

**Затронутые интеграции:** Twilio — indirectly protected (mobile must never register a WebRTC Device; desktop warm-up gesture preserved). Front / Zenbooker / Stripe / VAPI / Google Places — нет.

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):**
- `useTwilioDevice` hook and its `enabled` gating; `SoftPhoneWidget`; incoming-call auto-open logic; presence.
- `softPhoneEnabled = !isMobile && softPhoneGroupsLoaded && groups.length > 0` (`AppLayout.tsx:44`) — semantics unchanged.
- `warmUpAudio()` user-gesture contract (softphone-warmup canon) — every dismiss path keeps the gesture.
- Nav badge fetch/poll/SSE plumbing (`fetchUnreadCount`, `fetchLeadsNewCount`, `fetchOpenTasksCount`, `onGenericEvent`) — reused, not modified.
- `GET /api/tasks/count` default behavior + role-scoping branch (`canManage`/`scopeOwnerId`); `tasksQueries.buildConditions`/`countTasks` (no changes there).
- All 26 `useIsMobile` consumers, especially the overlay canon swap in `ui/dialog.tsx` / `ui/select.tsx` / `ui/popover.tsx` / `ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` / `useOverlayDismiss.ts` (OVERLAY-CANON-002) and the mobile list shells (`JobsPage`/`LeadsPage`/`PulsePage`/`TasksPage`/`SchedulePage`).
- The `/schedule` suppression in the Dialog `open` expression (`!location.pathname.startsWith('/schedule')`) — keep it.

## YELP-LEAD-AUTORESPONDER-002 — refactor the synchronous in-hook autoresponder onto the durable task+agent model (AUTO-001) (2026-07-10)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Backend-only** · **Date:** 2026-07-10
**Foundation:** YELP-LEAD-AUTORESPONDER-001 (commit `ca02db7`, committed **NOT deployed**) +
AUTO-001 (agentWorker / agentHandlers / `tasks.kind='agent'`, migration `100`).

### Context (what 001 built, why 002)
Phase 1a (001) does everything **synchronously inside the ingest path**:
`emailTimelineService.linkInboundMessage` step (a.4) calls
`yelpLeadService.maybeHandleYelpLead`, which in ONE call does detect → claim
(`yelp_lead_events`, mig 162) → parse → `createLead` → build+send greeting →
`markGreeted`. This couples the greeting (Gemini + email send, seconds of latency,
external failure surface) to the mail-ingest tick and sits logically adjacent to the
Mail-Secretary branch. 002 keeps 001's proven idempotency ledger but **splits the flow**:
a deterministic detector creates the lead + enqueues a durable `kind='agent'`,
`agent_type='yelp_lead'` task; the shared `agentWorker` claims it; a new `yelp_lead`
handler generates + sends the greeting and closes the task `done`. Robust, retryable,
observable, and independent of the Mail Secretary. **No new customer-visible surface,
no new external integration** — same Gemini greeting + same Yelp email relay, just moved
off the hot path onto the AUTO-001 queue.

### Owner-approved product decisions (binding)
1. **Lead in the detector, greeting in the agent task.** The lead is created
   synchronously by the detector for instant Pulse visibility; the greeting is sent
   asynchronously by the `yelp_lead` handler.
2. **Retry = max 3 attempts + backoff, then a dispatcher-VISIBLE "stuck" state** — never
   a silent terminal failure.
3. **Reuse the shared `agentWorker`, but the retry change is ADDITIVE + OPT-IN.** Existing
   agent types (`job_geocode`/`route_calc`/`zb_job_sync`, and `noop`/`mcp_tool`/
   `summarize_thread`) keep today's exact single-attempt, terminal-`failed` behavior.

### Functional requirements

- **R1 — `R-detector-enqueues-not-greets` (detector = deterministic, lead + enqueue, no greeting).**
  An INDEPENDENT, no-LLM detector runs on inbound-email ingest. On a Yelp *new-lead* email
  (unchanged 001 gate: `@messaging.yelp.com` relay **AND** a first-message signal) it, in
  order: atomically claims the message (`yelp_lead_events`, mig 162) → parses (fail-safe)
  → creates the `JobSource='Yelp'` lead → enqueues ONE `kind='agent'`, `agent_type='yelp_lead'`,
  `agent_status='queued'`, `status='open'` task carrying the parsed context (name, service,
  problem, `reply_to`, `thread_token`, `lead_id`, `provider_message_id`, `company_id`) in
  `agent_input`. The detector itself NEVER builds or sends a greeting. Customer replies
  (`request_a_quote_new_message`) and `no-reply@*yelp.com` confirmations are never claimed.

- **R2 — `R-yelp_lead-handler-greets-then-closes` (handler = greet then close done).**
  A new `yelp_lead` entry in the `agentHandlers` registry: reads `agent_input`, builds the
  greeting via `yelpGreetingService` (unchanged Gemini transport + deterministic static
  fallback; no price quoted), sends exactly one email-reply to `reply_to` through the Yelp
  relay, records the greeting on the claim (`markGreeted`), and returns an output object so
  the worker marks the task `agent_status='succeeded'`, `status='done'`. A missing `reply_to`
  → close as handled-no-send (never misroute), not a retryable error.

- **R3 — `R-retry-3-backoff-then-visible-stuck` (opt-in retry).**
  For agent types that OPT IN (only `yelp_lead` in this feature), a failed handler run is
  re-queued with backoff up to a max of **3 attempts** (env-tunable). After the 3rd failure
  the task lands in a **dispatcher-VISIBLE "stuck" state** (surfaced in Pulse, distinct from
  a pending task), NOT a silent `failed`. Attempt count + last error are recorded on the task
  for the dispatcher.

- **R4 — `R-idempotency` (one lead + one task per email; handler retry-safe; at-most-one greeting).**
  (a) The `yelp_lead_events` UNIQUE(`company_id`,`provider_message_id`) claim guarantees
  **exactly one lead and exactly one enqueued task** per inbound Yelp email across the
  push+poll re-scan race. (b) The handler is **retry-safe**: each attempt (including retries
  from R3) results in **at most one greeting per thread** — it checks `threadAlreadyGreeted`
  (mig 162 defense-in-depth, keyed on `company_id`+`thread_token`) and NEVER double-sends;
  a re-run after a greeting already went out closes the task without re-sending. This is
  hard-required because **Yelp permits only one email-reply per thread** — a double-send is
  both wrong and externally rejected.

- **R5 — `R-decoupled-from-Mail-Secretary` (zero dependency on the Mail Secretary).**
  The detector runs and succeeds regardless of whether the Mail Secretary
  (`mailAgentService`) is enabled, healthy, or reachable; it shares no code path, no queue,
  and no ordering dependency with it. For a Yelp new-lead the ingest still short-circuits
  with `{skipped:'yelp_lead'}` so the Secretary creates **no** duplicate review/AR task; for
  all NON-Yelp mail the Secretary path is **untouched**.

- **R6 — `R-existing-agent-types-unaffected-by-retry` (additive/opt-in retry).**
  Because R3 is opt-in, `job_geocode`, `route_calc`, `zb_job_sync`, `noop`, `mcp_tool`, and
  `summarize_thread` retain byte-for-byte today's behavior: single attempt, on failure
  `agent_status='failed'` (terminal), one `agent_task.failed` event, no re-queue, no backoff,
  no stuck state. `agent_task.succeeded`/`agent_task.failed` event contracts are preserved.

- **R7 — `R-safe-fail` (a Yelp failure never crashes the pipeline OR the worker loop).**
  Any detect/parse/greet/send failure is contained: a detector fault is fail-open (mirrors
  001's step-(a.4) try/catch) and the email falls through the normal ingest path — it never
  crashes the push route or poll tick; a handler fault is caught per-task by the worker
  (`processBatch` try/catch + `processBatch().catch`) and never crashes the worker loop or
  the sibling tasks in the same batch. The new retry/backoff/stuck logic is itself wrapped so
  it cannot throw out of the loop.

- **R8 — `R-lead-at-least-once` (releaseClaim on createLead failure).**
  If `createLead` throws, the detector releases the claim (`releaseClaim`) so the next poll
  re-scan re-attempts the lead (**lead at-least-once**). The claim is HELD once the lead
  exists so the greeting stays **at-most-once**. (See boundary B1: the claim must equally
  guarantee the *task* is enqueued once the lead exists — a claimed-but-taskless email must
  not become a silent no-greeting.)

### Non-functional requirements

- **N1 — Additive / backend-only.** No frontend, no new external integration, no DNS/GCP/
  browser automation. New agent_type is a single registry entry; new columns/states are
  additive migrations; the detector reuses 001's `yelpGreetingService`, `yelpLeadQueries`,
  and `leadsService.createLead`. `yelp_lead` is enqueued directly by the detector (like
  `job_geocode`/`zb_job_sync`), so it need NOT be added to the rules `AGENT_TYPES` catalog
  and does NOT appear as a user-selectable rule action.
- **N2 — Company-scoped.** Every query, the claim, the task (`company_id NOT NULL`), and the
  handler stay tenant-isolated; the worker only claims `company_id IS NOT NULL` agent tasks.
- **N3 — Env-gated, default OFF, default-company rollout.** `YELP_AUTORESPONDER_ENABLED`
  (default OFF) gates the detector; Phase-1a scope stays the default company
  (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`). Retry bound tunable via env (e.g.
  `YELP_LEAD_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, default 3), reusing `AGENT_WORKER_INTERVAL_MS` for cadence.
- **N4 — Observable / low-latency.** The task is visible to the dispatcher in Pulse; on the
  happy path the greeting is sent within **≤ one worker tick (~5s, `AGENT_WORKER_INTERVAL_MS`
  default 5000)** of enqueue. Exactly one structured success log line per handled lead; a
  stuck task is greppable and Pulse-visible.
- **N5 — Retry is a widening, not a rewrite.** The `agent_status` CHECK constraint (mig 100:
  `queued|running|succeeded|failed`) and any new attempt/stuck columns are added via an
  **additive** migration (widen the CHECK / `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` with safe defaults);
  no existing row or agent type changes meaning.

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC1 (R1):** A gated Yelp new-lead email produces exactly one Pulse-visible lead AND one
  `kind='agent'`/`agent_type='yelp_lead'`/`agent_status='queued'` task; no greeting is sent by
  the ingest tick itself. A customer reply / `no-reply@` confirmation produces neither.
- **AC2 (R2):** The worker claims the queued task on the next tick; the handler sends exactly
  one relay greeting to `reply_to` and the task ends `agent_status='succeeded'`,`status='done'`.
  A task with no `reply_to` ends closed-no-send, not errored.
- **AC3 (R3):** A handler forced to fail is re-queued with backoff and retried up to 3 attempts;
  on the 3rd failure it enters the dispatcher-visible stuck state (not silent `failed`), with
  attempt count + last error recorded.
- **AC4 (R4):** Re-ingesting the same `provider_message_id` (push+poll overlap) creates no
  second lead and no second task. Running the handler twice on one thread (natural retry OR a
  crash between send and mark) sends **at most one** greeting; the second run closes without
  re-sending.
- **AC5 (R5):** With `mailAgentService` disabled/erroring, a Yelp new-lead is still detected,
  lead created, task enqueued, greeting sent; the Secretary logs no duplicate review/AR task
  for it. A non-Yelp inbound email reaches the Secretary exactly as before.
- **AC6 (R6):** A forced `job_geocode`/`route_calc`/`zb_job_sync` failure still goes terminal
  `failed` with one `agent_task.failed` event — no re-queue, no backoff, no stuck state.
- **AC7 (R7):** A thrown detector (e.g. parse/claim fault) leaves the ingest pipeline running
  (email flows through normally); a thrown handler leaves the worker loop and the other tasks
  in the batch running.
- **AC8 (R8):** A `createLead` failure releases the claim and the next poll re-creates the
  lead (lead at-least-once); once the lead exists the claim is held so no duplicate lead and
  no duplicate greeting occur.

### Out of scope
- Phase 1b headless Yelp Business login / phone-behind-the-button reveal (separate later
  track that enriches the lead created here).
- SMS / voice channels; any browser automation, DNS, or GCP work.
- A general-purpose retry framework for all agent types (retry stays opt-in, `yelp_lead`-only).
- A rules-editor entry for `yelp_lead` (enqueued by the detector, not user-configurable).

### Involved modules (summary)
- **backend/src/services/agentWorker.js** — add opt-in retry/backoff + stuck transition to the
  failure branch (additive; default path unchanged).
- **backend/src/services/agentHandlers.js** — register the new `yelp_lead` handler.
- **backend/src/services/yelpLeadService.js** — split: keep detect/parse/claim/createLead as
  the detector; move greet+send into (or called by) the handler; drop the synchronous greet.
- **backend/src/db/yelpLeadQueries.js** — reuse `claimYelpLead`/`releaseClaim`/`markGreeted`/
  `threadAlreadyGreeted`; add task linkage if B1 needs it.
- **backend/src/services/yelpGreetingService.js** — reused unchanged by the handler.
- **backend/src/services/email/emailTimelineService.js** — step (a.4) now invokes the detector
  (lead+enqueue) and still returns `{skipped:'yelp_lead'}`.
- **backend/db/migrations/** — new additive migration: attempt/stuck columns + widened
  `agent_status` CHECK (builds on mig 100 + mig 162).
- **Pulse tasks/AR projection** — surface the stuck agent task to the dispatcher (see B2).

### Affected integrations
- **Gemini** (greeting generation) and the **Yelp email relay** (outbound reply) — reused
  unchanged, just moved onto the agent task. **Zenbooker/Twilio/Front:** none.

### Protected code (MUST NOT break)
- The `agentWorker` claim (`UPDATE … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED RETURNING *`) and the
  `agent_task.succeeded`/`.failed` event contracts — retry is additive to the failure branch
  only; the success branch and the default (non-opt-in) failure branch stay identical.
- Existing handlers `job_geocode`/`route_calc`/`zb_job_sync`/`noop`/`mcp_tool`/
  `summarize_thread` — unchanged behavior.
- The 001 idempotency ledger `yelp_lead_events` (mig 162) invariants: UNIQUE claim,
  release-only-on-createLead-failure, greeting at-most-once, `threadAlreadyGreeted` guard.
- `emailTimelineService.linkInboundMessage` ordering: the Yelp intercept stays BEFORE the
  mute guard and BEFORE the no-contact Mail-Secretary branch, fail-open, `!opts.skipAgent`.
- `tasks` mig-100 schema semantics for user tasks and other agent types (additive columns
  only; existing CHECK values keep their meaning).

### ⚑ Boundaries / edge-cases for the Architect + Implementer to resolve
- **B1 — Detector atomicity (lead ↔ task).** Owner splits "lead in detector, greeting in
  task," but the `yelp_lead_events` claim is held once the lead exists (R8) — so if the
  process dies AFTER `createLead` but BEFORE the task is enqueued, the message is claimed,
  the lead exists, yet **no task and no greeting ever follow** (a silent gap). Resolve:
  (a) enqueue the task in the SAME transaction that creates the lead / finalizes the claim;
  or (b) stamp `task_id` on the claim row and have the detector treat "claimed row with a
  `lead_id` but no `task_id`" as re-enqueue-only (idempotent on the lead, safe on re-scan);
  or (c) a small reconciler. Do NOT release-after-lead (would duplicate the lead).
- **B2 — How the stuck task is dispatcher-visible in Pulse.** Agent tasks may have
  `thread_id = NULL` (AUTO-001 dropped the NOT NULL); Pulse Action-Required today = *has an
  open task on a thread* (AR→Tasks unify). A `yelp_lead` task is `status='open'` but by
  default unattached — so a "stuck" one may not surface anywhere a dispatcher looks. Resolve
  how it appears: attach the task to the created lead's timeline/subject, and/or set
  action-required, and/or a dedicated stuck view — and pick the "stuck" representation
  (widen `agent_status` CHECK to add `stuck`, vs. `status`+attempts-exhausted flag), since the
  mig-100 CHECK currently forbids any value beyond `queued|running|succeeded|failed`.
- **B3 — Send-then-crash double-send window.** The handler checks `threadAlreadyGreeted`
  → `sendEmail` → `markGreeted`; a crash BETWEEN send and mark, now that R3 makes the task
  retryable, would re-send on the next attempt — which Yelp rejects (one reply per thread).
  Resolve the ordering so a greeting is **at-most-once** even across a crash (e.g. record a
  durable "send attempted" marker BEFORE the send so recovery defaults to not-resending,
  trading a rare lost greeting for never double-sending — aligned with the one-reply rule).
- **B4 — Backoff claim predicate.** The current claim query has no time gate; honoring R3
  backoff needs an additive predicate (e.g. `AND (next_attempt_at IS NULL OR next_attempt_at
  <= now())`) that must NOT change scheduling for non-opt-in agent types (they never set it,
  so `NULL` → claim-immediately as today). Confirm the `idx_tasks_agent_queue` index still
  covers the widened claim.
- **B5 — Env-flag flip mid-flight.** Decide whether `YELP_AUTORESPONDER_ENABLED` gates only
  the detector (a task already enqueued still runs to completion) or is re-checked in the
  handler. Recommended: gate at detect only, so a queued greeting is not stranded if the flag
  is toggled off after enqueue.
- **B6 — Old synchronous path removal.** 001's in-hook greet+send must be fully removed (not
  left dormant) so a greeting can never be sent twice (once synchronously, once by the task).

## YELP-CONVO-BOOKING-001 — turn the one-shot Yelp autoresponder into a robust MULTI-TURN conversational booking agent that drives every lead to a BOOKING or a CALL, reusing the voice agent's scheduling tools (2026-07-11)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Backend-only** · **Date:** 2026-07-11
**Foundation:** YELP-LEAD-AUTORESPONDER-002 (`d584997`, deployed 2026-07-11) — durable
detector→`kind='agent'`/`agent_type='yelp_lead'` task→`agentWorker`→handler pipeline +
`yelp_lead_events` idempotency ledger (mig 162) + opt-in retry (mig 163). Reuses the
AGENT-AGNOSTIC skills choke-point `agentSkills.runSkill(name, companyId, rawContext, input)`
(`backend/src/services/agentSkills/index.js:104`) that the VOICE agent (Sara, VAPI adapter)
and MCP already call — the email agent is a **third in-process caller**, no new plumbing.

### Context (what 002 is, why 001-CONVO)
002 (LIVE) is **one-shot**: detect a Yelp new-lead email → create a `JobSource='Yelp'` lead
→ enqueue one `yelp_lead` task → the handler sends **exactly ONE** templated/Gemini greeting
and closes `done`. No tools, no follow-ups, and — critically — `detectYelpLead` returns
**false** for customer replies (`utm_source=request_a_quote_new_message`,
`backend/src/services/yelpLeadService.js:74`), so **replies reach no agent at all**. Owner's
goal (verbatim): «агент должен устойчиво вести разговор и доводить до бука или звонка нам» —
robustly conduct the conversation and drive **each** Yelp lead to **a booking OR a call to
us**, reusing the **same** scheduling/slot/booking tools the voice agent uses. This feature
adds a multi-turn conversational driver on top of 002's durable task model: it intercepts
both the first message AND respondable replies, keeps durable conversation state, runs an
LLM tool-calling loop over the reusable `agentSkills` L0 tools, proactively offers the
nearest slot, autonomously holds an accepted slot on the existing lead, and — when booking
isn't reachable — hands off to a phone call. A warm phone handoff is a **success**, not a
failure. **Prereqs confirmed LIVE on prod:** slot-engine container healthy,
`SLOT_ENGINE_URL=http://slot-engine:4500`, `smart-slot-engine` marketplace app CONNECTED for
the default company ⇒ `recommendSlots` returns real slots.

### Owner-approved product decisions (binding)
1. **Book OR call — both are success.** The terminal goal of every conversation is a real
   slot hold on the lead **or** a warm phone handoff (our number given + their callback
   number captured + a dispatcher flagged). Neither is a failure.
2. **Reuse the voice agent's tools verbatim.** Scheduling/slot logic goes through the SAME
   `agentSkills.runSkill(...)` choke-point the voice agent uses — no forked slot logic.
3. **Offer the nearest available slot EARLY** («лучше давать самый ближайший доступный слот
   сразу») rather than open-ended back-and-forth.
4. **Ask for the data we lack, don't scrape it.** Email leads carry no phone — ask directly
   for phone + full address + appliance/problem + preferred time in-conversation. This
   obviates browser phone-scraping (explicitly out of scope).
5. **Hold the slot by updating the EXISTING lead**, never by `createLead` (which hardcodes
   `JobSource='AI Phone'`) and never through the phone-gated `bookOnLead` — the task already
   carries `lead_id`, so book via a direct `leadsService.updateLead(...)` on that lead.
6. **Bounded, one-reply-per-message, never double-book.** One outbound reply per respondable
   inbound message; ≤~6 turns then hand off to a human; no price quoted unless a tool returns
   one; never double-book.

### Functional requirements

- **R1 — `R-intercept-first-AND-replies-by-conv-id` (multi-turn intercept keyed by the stable conversation id).**
  The Yelp intercept catches BOTH the first new-lead email (as 002 does) AND subsequent
  customer replies (`request_a_quote_new_message`, marked `…_RESPONDABLE` — Yelp supports
  replying to follow-ups), which 002 today drops. Replies are routed to the SAME conversation
  by the **stable conversation id** embedded in the body (`message_to_business_conversation/<convId>`
  in the first email = `%2Fthread%2F<convId>` in replies), **NOT** by the per-message-varying
  `reply+<hex>@messaging.yelp.com` address. First message ⇒ create lead + start a conversation;
  a reply ⇒ resume the existing conversation for that conv-id. `no-reply@*yelp.com`
  confirmations are still never intercepted.

- **R2 — `R-durable-conversation-state` (persisted state + phase machine).**
  A durable per-conversation record keyed by (`company_id`, `conv_id`) holds: `phase`, gathered
  data (best `phone`, full `address`, appliance/`problem`, preferred `time`), the currently
  offered/held slot, `turn_count`, the message/transcript history the LLM loop needs, the last
  handled inbound `provider_message_id`, and the terminal `outcome`. It survives process
  restarts (persisted, not in-memory) so a reply days later resumes mid-conversation. Phases
  (indicative): `greeting → gathering → slot_offered → booked | call_handoff | stuck`.

- **R3 — `R-llm-tool-loop-over-agentSkills` (net-new conversational driver calling the reusable tools).**
  A NEW conversational driver runs a bounded **LLM tool-calling loop** (net-new — the repo has
  NO Gemini function-calling harness; all current LLM use is single-shot text). Per inbound
  turn it may invoke the reusable, agent-agnostic L0 read tools THROUGH the in-process
  `agentSkills.runSkill(name, companyId, rawContext, input)` choke-point: `validateAddress`
  (→lat/lng), `checkServiceArea` (zip→in-area), `recommendSlots` (engine-ranked;
  `targetDay`+`targetTime` ⇒ the single NEAREST window), with `checkAvailability` as fallback.
  These are the EXACT tools the voice agent calls — no new adapter, no duplicated slot logic.
  The loop's objective is to drive the conversation toward a booking (R6) or a call (R7).

- **R4 — `R-gather-missing-data-in-conversation` (ask, don't scrape).**
  Because an email lead has no phone, the agent explicitly asks, conversationally, for: best
  callback **phone**, full service **address** (for geocode + slot), **appliance/problem**
  confirmation, and preferred **time** — gathering whatever is still missing, one coherent
  question-set per reply. This is what obviates the parked browser/phone-scrape track.

- **R5 — `R-proactive-nearest-slot` (offer the nearest window early).**
  As soon as the address validates and is confirmed in-area, the agent PROACTIVELY offers the
  nearest available slot (`recommendSlots` with `targetDay`+`targetTime` ⇒ the single nearest
  window) rather than an open-ended "when works for you?" loop.

- **R6 — `R-autonomous-hold-via-updateLead` (book on accept, on the existing lead).**
  On customer slot-accept the agent autonomously HOLDS the slot on the EXISTING Yelp lead by
  calling `leadsService.updateLead(lead_id, {LeadDateTime, LeadEndDateTime, Latitude, Longitude},
  companyId)` directly (the task carries `lead_id`; JobSource stays `'Yelp'`). It does NOT
  `createLead` (would orphan a second `'AI Phone'` lead) and does NOT route through the
  phone-identity-gated `bookOnLead`. The hold is dispatcher-visible AND is counted by the slot
  engine as occupancy (double-book mitigation), reusing the same tz/window→`LeadDateTime`
  mapping (`slotEngineService.tzCombine`) that `bookOnLead` uses for voice holds.

- **R7 — `R-book-or-call-terminal` (fall back to a warm phone handoff).**
  Every conversation ends in one of two SUCCESS terminals: a slot hold (R6) OR a warm phone
  handoff — give our number, ask for the customer's callback number, and flag the dispatcher
  (open a task on the lead for a human call). The agent falls back to CALL when: the slot
  engine / a required tool is unavailable, the customer prefers phone or opts out, critical
  data is still missing after the bounded turns, or the customer explicitly asks to talk to a
  person. A call handoff is recorded as a successful outcome, not an error.

- **R8 — `R-one-reply-per-message-bounded-turns` (Yelp reply budget + turn cap).**
  Exactly ONE outbound email-reply per respondable inbound message (Yelp permits one reply per
  respondable message). The conversation is bounded to ≤~6 turns (env-tunable); on exhaustion
  it terminates in the human/phone handoff (R7). No price is quoted unless a tool returns one.
  Never double-book.

- **R9 — `R-idempotent-retryable-safe-fail` (at-most-once per message; never crash the loop).**
  Each inbound message is processed at-most-once (idempotency keyed on `provider_message_id`,
  extending 002's `yelp_lead_events` ledger). Each conversational turn runs as a retryable
  task on the shared `agentWorker` (reusing 002's opt-in retry/backoff/stuck). Any LLM / tool /
  send fault is caught per-task and NEVER crashes the worker loop or sibling tasks; the loop is
  safe-fail. A crash mid-turn re-runs the turn idempotently — at-most-one outbound reply AND
  at-most-one slot hold, even across a retry.

- **R10 — `R-decoupled-from-Mail-Secretary` (replies too).**
  Both the first-message AND the reply interception short-circuit the Mail Secretary (no
  duplicate review/AR task) and share no code path, queue, or ordering dependency with it;
  all NON-Yelp mail reaches the Secretary exactly as before. (Extends 002's R5 to replies.)

### Non-functional requirements

- **N1 — Reuse-first; minimal net-new.** Reuse the in-process `runSkill` choke-point (the email
  agent is the 3rd caller after VAPI + MCP — no new adapter plumbing), the L0 read tools,
  `leadsService.updateLead`, the `agentWorker`+`agentHandlers` task model, and the
  `yelp_lead_events` idempotency ledger. **Net-new is only:** (a) the LLM tool-calling loop
  driver; (b) the durable conversation-state store + the reply intercept.
- **N2 — Company-scoped; default-company rollout.** Default company only
  (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`); every query, task, state row, and tool call is
  tenant-isolated (`company_id NOT NULL`).
- **N3 — Env-gated.** Reuses/extends `YELP_AUTORESPONDER_ENABLED` (default OFF) to gate the
  multi-turn behavior; the turn cap and per-turn tool-call cap are env-tunable; worker cadence
  reuses `AGENT_WORKER_INTERVAL_MS`.
- **N4 — Prereqs already LIVE (no infra work).** slot-engine healthy,
  `SLOT_ENGINE_URL=http://slot-engine:4500`, `smart-slot-engine` app CONNECTED for the default
  company ⇒ `recommendSlots` returns real slots. No DNS/GCP/browser/infra work in scope.
- **N5 — Safe-fail / graceful slot-engine-unavailable.** If the slot engine or any tool is
  unavailable or refuses, the loop degrades to the CALL fallback (R7) — it never crashes and
  never leaves the customer silently stranded.
- **N6 — Backend-only; no new scheduling UI.** No net-new scheduling UI; dispatcher visibility
  (the held slot, the call-handoff flag, the stuck state) reuses existing Pulse lead/task
  surfaces.
- **N7 — Observable.** Structured per-turn logs (tool calls, decisions, outcome); conversation
  state + terminal outcome are greppable and dispatcher-visible in Pulse.

### Acceptance criteria

- **AC1 (R1):** A customer reply on an existing Yelp thread is intercepted and routed to the
  SAME conversation via the stable conv-id (not the varying `reply+<hex>@` address); a first
  new-lead email starts a new conversation; a `no-reply@` confirmation is ignored.
- **AC2 (R2):** Conversation state (phase, gathered data, offered/held slot, turn count,
  history, last `provider_message_id`) persists across a backend restart; a reply after the
  restart resumes the conversation mid-flight, not from scratch.
- **AC3 (R3):** During a turn the driver invokes `validateAddress` / `checkServiceArea` /
  `recommendSlots` via `agentSkills.runSkill(...)` — the SAME entrypoint the voice agent uses,
  with no new HTTP plumbing; a tool refusal/`SAFE_FALLBACK` is handled, not fatal.
- **AC4 (R4/R5):** Given an email lead with no phone, the agent asks for phone + full address;
  once the address geocodes and is confirmed in-area, it proactively offers the single nearest
  available slot without an open-ended availability loop.
- **AC5 (R6):** On accept, the EXISTING lead's `LeadDateTime`/`LeadEndDateTime`/`Latitude`/
  `Longitude` are set via `updateLead` (JobSource stays `'Yelp'`, no second lead, `bookOnLead`
  not invoked); the hold is dispatcher-visible and occupies the slot in the engine.
- **AC6 (R7):** When the slot engine is down, the customer opts out / prefers phone, critical
  data is still missing after the bounded turns, or the customer explicitly asks for a person →
  the agent gives our number, asks for theirs, opens a dispatcher call-task on the lead, and
  records the outcome as a (successful) call-handoff.
- **AC7 (R8):** Exactly one outbound reply is sent per respondable inbound message; after ≤~6
  turns without a booking the conversation terminates in a human handoff; no double-book occurs;
  no price is quoted unless a tool returned one.
- **AC8 (R9):** Re-delivering the same inbound `provider_message_id` (push+poll overlap)
  produces no second reply and no second hold; a forced mid-turn crash re-runs the turn
  idempotently (at-most-one send, at-most-one hold); a thrown LLM/tool never crashes the worker
  loop or the sibling tasks in the batch.
- **AC9 (R10):** With the Mail Secretary disabled/erroring, BOTH a first Yelp message and a
  reply are still handled end-to-end; neither creates a duplicate Secretary review/AR task; a
  non-Yelp inbound email reaches the Secretary exactly as before.

### Out of scope
- Browser / headless Yelp-Business login and phone-behind-the-button scraping — obviated by
  asking the customer for their phone in-conversation (R4); stays a separate parked track.
- The voice channel (Sara / VAPI) — this feature only reuses her tools, it does not change her.
- Non-default companies — default-company rollout only.
- Any net-new scheduling UI — dispatcher visibility reuses existing Pulse surfaces.
- A general slot-hold-release/TTL framework beyond what B6 resolves for this feature.

### Involved modules (summary)
- **backend/src/services/yelpLeadService.js** — extend detection to route respondable replies
  (today `detectYelpLead` drops them, line 74); parse/extract the stable conv-id from both the
  first-email and reply body forms.
- **backend/src/services/email/emailTimelineService.js** — the Yelp intercept (step a.4) now
  also catches replies and enqueues a conversational **turn** task, still short-circuiting the
  Mail Secretary (`{skipped:'yelp_lead'}`); stays fail-open, BEFORE the mute/Secretary branch.
- **backend/src/services/agentHandlers.js** — a `yelp_lead` (or new `yelp_convo`) handler that
  runs one turn of the LLM tool-loop and emits at most one reply.
- **NEW conversational-driver module** — the LLM tool-calling loop + tolerant tool-JSON parsing
  + the book-vs-call decision (net-new; no harness exists to reuse).
- **backend/src/services/agentSkills/index.js** (`runSkill`, line 104) + **agentSkills/registry.js**
  — reused unchanged as the tool entrypoint (`validateAddress`/`checkServiceArea`/`recommendSlots`/
  `checkAvailability`); the email agent is a new in-process caller only.
- **backend/src/services/leadsService.js** (`updateLead`, line 370) — the booking primitive for
  the autonomous slot hold; reuse `slotEngineService.tzCombine` for the window→`LeadDateTime` map.
- **backend/src/services/agentWorker.js** — reuse 002's opt-in retry/backoff/stuck for turn tasks
  (additive; no change to non-opt-in agent types).
- **backend/src/db/** + **backend/db/migrations/** — NEW additive migration(s): the durable
  conversation-state store (keyed `company_id`+`conv_id`) + reply-turn idempotency, building on
  `yelp_lead_events` (mig 162) and the retry columns (mig 163).
- **Pulse lead/task/AR projection** — surface the held slot, the call-handoff dispatcher task,
  and the stuck state (reuse 002's stuck-visibility work).

### Affected integrations
- **Gemini** (the conversational LLM + tool-calling loop) and the **Yelp email relay**
  (bidirectional replies) — reused/extended. **Slot engine** (`smart-slot-engine` marketplace
  app, already CONNECTED) via `recommendSlots`/`checkAvailability`. **Twilio/Front:** none.
  **Zenbooker:** none directly (the lead hold is a CRM `updateLead`, not a ZB write).

### Protected code (MUST NOT break)
- The `agentSkills.runSkill` choke-point and the L0 tool contracts — the email agent is an
  ADDITIVE in-process caller; the VAPI/voice and MCP adapters and the tool signatures stay
  byte-for-byte unchanged. No forked slot logic.
- The voice `bookOnLead` path and its phone-identity resolution — untouched; the email hold
  goes around it via `updateLead`, it does not modify or re-gate `bookOnLead`.
- `leadsService.updateLead` and `createLead` semantics — reused as-is; the email agent never
  re-`createLead`s a Yelp lead (JobSource must stay `'Yelp'`).
- 002's `yelp_lead_events` (mig 162) idempotency invariants, the `agentWorker` claim
  (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED RETURNING *`) + `agent_task.succeeded`/`.failed` event contracts, and
  the mig-163 opt-in retry semantics (non-opt-in agent types unchanged).
- `emailTimelineService.linkInboundMessage` ordering — the Yelp intercept (now incl. replies)
  stays BEFORE the mute guard and the no-contact Mail-Secretary branch, fail-open,
  `!opts.skipAgent`.
- The single-reply-per-thread rule — 002's at-most-one-greeting guard must not regress; the
  multi-turn agent still sends **at most one reply per respondable inbound message**.

### ⚑ Boundaries / edge-cases for the Architect + Implementer to resolve
- **B1 — Conversation-state model + conv-id keying (the core new entity).** Decide where durable
  state lives: a NEW table keyed (`company_id`,`conv_id`) that owns phase/data/history/outcome,
  vs. hanging state off the existing lead + a chain of turn-tasks. Make conv-id extraction robust
  across BOTH body forms (`message_to_business_conversation/<convId>` in the first email,
  `%2Fthread%2F<convId>` in replies) and independent of the varying `reply+<hex>@` address.
  Resolve the mapping conv_id ↔ lead_id ↔ turn-task, and how a reply enqueues a NEW turn-task
  onto the SAME conversation without re-running the first-message lead-create path.
- **B2 — Reply-intercept placement + the `detectYelpLead` gate change.** Today `detectYelpLead`
  returns false for `request_a_quote_new_message` (line 74), so replies reach no agent. Resolve
  where the reply intercept sits inside `linkInboundMessage` (must stay BEFORE the mute +
  Secretary branch, fail-open) and how a reply is disambiguated as "belongs to an ACTIVE Yelp
  conversation" (match on conv-id → existing state) vs. a stray relay email — WITHOUT the reply
  accidentally tripping the first-message `createLead` path.
- **B3 — LLM tool-loop: turn/stop conditions (net-new; no harness exists).** Define the per-turn
  loop precisely: the system prompt/goal, which tools are exposed, the INNER bound (max tool
  calls per turn) AND the OUTER bound (max conversation turns, ≤~6), how the model signals its
  intent (ask-a-question / offer-slot / accept / hand-off), how malformed tool-JSON is tolerated
  (reuse the tolerant-LLM-JSON-parser lesson), and the stop condition that guarantees EXACTLY
  ONE outbound reply is emitted per inbound message (R8). Pick the provider harness (Gemini
  function-calling vs. a hand-rolled JSON tool protocol) — none exists to reuse.
- **B4 — Book-vs-call decision logic (the crux).** Specify exactly WHEN the loop chooses to HOLD
  a slot vs. HAND OFF to a call: the free-text accept-detection (customer agreeing to an offered
  window in prose email), the required-data threshold for a valid hold (address geocoded +
  in-area + a chosen window + a callback phone), and the precise fallback triggers (engine
  unavailable, opt-out/prefers-phone, missing-data-after-N-turns, explicit ask). Make "call" a
  first-class SUCCESS branch with its own dispatcher artifact, not an error/`stuck`.
- **B5 — Double-send / double-hold across retries (extend 002's B3 to every turn).** Yelp permits
  one reply per respondable message and a retried turn must re-send NEITHER the email NOR the
  slot hold. Resolve durable "reply-sent" and "slot-held" markers recorded BEFORE the side-effect
  so recovery defaults to not-repeating — at-most-once on BOTH the outbound reply AND the
  `updateLead` hold, even across a crash between side-effect and mark.
- **B6 — Held-slot occupancy vs. abandonment.** A hold counts as slot-engine occupancy (the
  double-book mitigation) — but a customer who never confirms / goes cold would sterilize a real
  window indefinitely. Resolve whether/when an unconfirmed hold is released (TTL? dispatcher
  action? on turn-cap handoff?) so held-then-abandoned leads don't starve availability, and how
  release interacts with the dispatcher-visible state.
- **B7 — Bypassing `bookOnLead` while staying consistent with voice holds.** `bookOnLead` is
  phone-identity-gated and re-`createLead` hardcodes `JobSource='AI Phone'`; the workaround
  `updateLead`s the existing `lead_id` directly. Resolve reusing `bookOnLead`'s window→
  `LeadDateTime` mapping (`slotEngineService.tzCombine`, tz handling) WITHOUT its identity
  resolution, so an email-booked hold is indistinguishable from a voice-booked hold to the slot
  engine and to the dispatcher (same occupancy + timeline semantics).
- **B8 — Post-terminal replies (re-open vs. stay closed).** Decide how a reply AFTER a terminal
  state is handled: a "thanks!" after a booking (stay closed, no new turn) vs. "can we move it?"
  (must NOT silently re-drive the booking loop into a double-book — route to a dispatcher
  reschedule). Define the terminal re-open rules and the turn-cap/`stuck` interaction so a
  chatty customer can't loop the agent indefinitely.

## YELP-TIMELINE-DEDUP-001 — one Yelp conversation → ONE timeline (keyed by the stable conv-id), suppress the junk relay contact, materialize a contact only via the lead path (2026-07-11)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Backend (+ a small Pulse-render tweak)** · **Date:** 2026-07-11
**Foundation:** YELP-LEAD-AUTORESPONDER-002 (`d584997`, deployed 2026-07-11) + YELP-CONVO-BOOKING-001
(above, Requirements) — reuses the stable-conv-id extractor `parseConversationId(msg)` and the durable
per-conversation store `yelp_conversations` (upserted by `yelpConversationQueries.upsertConversation(companyId, convId, …)`,
keyed `(company_id, conv_id)`) that CONVO-BOOKING introduces. The ingest seam is
`emailTimelineService.linkInboundMessage` (covers BOTH the push and poll legs). Cleanup reuses the
existing merge/relink primitives (`contactEmailMergeService.mergeContacts`/`linkInboxMessages`,
`timelineMergeService.mergeOrphanTimelines`).

> **Supersedes the abandoned YELP-CONTACT-IDENTITY-001 draft.** An earlier draft under that name
> modeled the fix as a stable *contact identity* for the Yelp relay. That model was ABANDONED —
> the owner's clarified intent is the opposite: do NOT create a contact from the Yelp email at all.
> The deliverable is a unified **timeline** keyed by the conversation id; a contact is materialized
> only later, via the lead path, with the real customer name. This section replaces it in full.

### Context (what is broken, why)
A single Yelp customer conversation reaches us as a series of inbound emails whose relay `From`
address **varies per message** (`reply+<hex>@messaging.yelp.com`), while the customer-facing
conversation is stable. In the normal ingest path (`linkInboundMessage` step (b)) each new relay
address is an unseen sender → `findEmailContact` misses → the no-contact branch hands the mail to
the Mail Secretary (`reviewInboundEmail({noContact:true})`), which may decide "this is a lead" and
call `createEmailContact`. Because the address is different every message, this fabricates a **new
junk contact and (via `findOrCreateTimelineByContact`) a new junk timeline per message** — one
conversation is shredded across N contacts + N timelines. Prod currently carries **8** such junk
contacts/timelines. Separately, even once the YELP autoresponder intercepts these emails, its
short-circuit returns `{skipped:'yelp_lead'}` / `{skipped:'yelp_convo'}` with **no link and no
timeline at all**, so the dispatcher cannot SEE the Yelp conversation in Pulse. Owner's clarified
intent (verbatim gist): *"if contacts aren't created now, don't create them — even better; the MAIN
thing is that timelines are unified — one timeline per correspondent; don't create a contact; create
a contact only when we have enough info to create a LEAD."*

### Owner-approved product decisions (binding)
1. **One timeline per conversation, keyed by the stable conv-id.** All messages of one Yelp
   conversation land on ONE timeline, regardless of the per-message-varying `reply+<hex>@` relay.
   The timeline may be **contactless** — that is fine and preferred.
2. **Never create a contact from the Yelp email/relay.** The junk relay contact is suppressed; the
   Yelp path must never reach `createEmailContact`/`findEmailContact`.
3. **A contact is materialized ONLY via the lead path** (the autoresponder's `createLead`, which
   carries the real customer name) — and even that is **secondary**: the unified timeline is the
   deliverable. When a contact is created it **attaches to the same conv-id timeline** (no second
   timeline).
4. **No junk for notifications.** A Yelp email with no parseable conv-id creates no timeline and no
   contact.
5. **Visible to the dispatcher.** The unified, contactless conv-id timeline must appear in Pulse,
   **labeled with the customer name**, without a junk contact.
6. **Zero per-request compute at serve time.** Resolution happens at write (ingest) time via an
   indexed find-or-create; serving a timeline stays a keyed read (no scan, no per-request grouping).
7. **Clean up the existing 8** junk contacts/timelines once — snapshot first, owner-confirmed
   mapping, consolidate each conversation's messages onto one timeline, delete the junk contacts.
   Irreversible; a separate owner-run operation, never auto-run.

### Functional requirements

- **R1 — `R-one-timeline-per-conversation` (keyed by conv-id, indexed-unique per company).**
  Each Yelp conversation resolves to exactly ONE timeline, identified by the stable
  `yelp_conversation_id` (from `parseConversationId(msg)`), unique per company. The mapping
  conv-id → timeline is materialized and indexed so that resolution is an indexed lookup, and a
  second conversation never collides onto the first's timeline.

- **R2 — `R-messages-into-one-timeline` (varying relay collapses to the one timeline).**
  EVERY inbound message of a conversation — the first new-lead email AND every subsequent reply,
  each arriving from a DIFFERENT `reply+<hex>@messaging.yelp.com` address — is linked to that single
  conv-id timeline. The varying relay address is NEVER used as the conversation key.

- **R3 — `R-no-contact-from-email` (the Yelp relay never creates a contact).**
  A Yelp inbound email NEVER causes a contact to be created and NEVER reaches
  `createEmailContact`/`findEmailContact`, nor the no-contact Mail-Secretary branch that would
  fabricate one. The junk relay contact is suppressed at the source.

- **R4 — `R-contact-only-via-lead` (a contact, if any, comes only from the lead path, and attaches
  to the conv-id timeline).** A contact is materialized ONLY by the autoresponder lead path
  (`createLead`, real customer name). When it is, it attaches to the EXISTING conv-id timeline
  (that one timeline gains a `contact_id`); it MUST NOT spawn a second, contact-keyed timeline for
  the same conversation. Absent a lead, the conversation stays a valid contactless timeline.

- **R5 — `R-no-junk-for-notifications` (no conv-id ⇒ no timeline, no contact).**
  A Yelp email with no parseable conv-id (and Yelp `no-reply@*yelp.com` confirmations) creates no
  timeline and no contact — it produces no new Pulse surface and, critically, never reaches
  `createEmailContact`.

- **R6 — `R-pulse-visible` (contactless conv-id timeline surfaces, labeled with the customer name).**
  The unified contactless timeline appears in the Pulse unified list (`getUnifiedTimelinePage`) and
  is labeled with the **customer name** (parsed from the Yelp lead), WITHOUT a junk contact — i.e.
  the display name is NOT sourced from a `contacts` row. It surfaces on its own signal (see B3) and
  orders sensibly by its own last-message recency.

- **R7 — `R-resolve-at-write-time` (indexed find-or-create at ingest; ZERO per-request compute at
  serve).** The conv-id → timeline resolution and all message-linking happen at ingest (write) time
  through an indexed find-or-create keyed on `(company_id, yelp_conversation_id)`. The serve path
  performs no grouping, no relay-address parsing, and no per-request compute; it reads the already-
  resolved, indexed timeline.

- **R8 — `R-cleanup-existing` (one-time, snapshot-first, owner-confirmed, irreversible).**
  A separate one-time operation consolidates the existing **8** junk conversations: it snapshots the
  affected contacts/timelines/message-links first, uses an owner-confirmed conv-id ↔ messages
  mapping, moves every message of a conversation onto that conversation's single timeline, and
  DELETES the junk contacts. It is irreversible, default-company scoped, owner-run — NEVER
  auto-executed by ingest or a migration.

- **R9 — `R-idempotent` (re-ingest ⇒ same timeline, one link).**
  Re-delivering the same `provider_message_id` (push + poll overlap, or a retry) resolves to the
  SAME conv-id timeline and produces no duplicate link, no duplicate unread bump, and no duplicate
  SSE — even though the message is contactless (`contact_id` NULL). Idempotency for a contactless
  link does NOT depend on a non-null `contact_id`.

- **R10 — `R-safe-fail` (a resolver fault never breaks ingest).**
  Any failure in conv-id parsing, timeline resolution, or contactless linking is contained and
  fail-open: the email falls through the normal ingest path (it must not crash the push route or the
  poll tick, and must not throw out of `linkInboundMessage`). A resolver fault must never
  accidentally re-enable the junk-contact path.

### Non-functional requirements
- **N1 — Default-company scoped.** Yelp is `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`)
  scoped; every query, the conv-id→timeline resolver, the link, and the cleanup are tenant-isolated
  (`company_id NOT NULL`).
- **N2 — Backend, plus a small Pulse-render tweak.** The core change is backend (ingest resolver +
  schema). A minimal Pulse-render change is expected ONLY to label/surface a contactless timeline
  (R6); no net-new Pulse screen.
- **N3 — No per-request compute (write-time resolution, keyed serve).** Enforces R7: the unified-list
  and single-timeline reads stay keyed lookups; no scan, no per-request relay parsing or grouping.
- **N4 — Additive migration.** Any schema change (the conv-id anchor on the timeline / the widened
  identity CHECK / a denormalized label column / index) is additive (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`,
  widen-CHECK, new partial unique index) — no existing row or timeline changes meaning; builds on
  mig 028/029 (timelines) and CONVO-BOOKING's `yelp_conversations`.
- **N5 — Cleanup is a separate, owner-confirmed, non-auto operation.** R8 runs only on explicit owner
  action (script/one-shot), snapshot-first; it is not wired into ingest and not part of the additive
  schema migration.
- **N6 — Reuse-first.** Reuse `parseConversationId`, the `yelp_conversations` store, the existing
  `linkMessageToContact`/`getMessageLinkState` link plumbing (adapted for `contact_id` NULL), and the
  merge/relink primitives for cleanup. Net-new is only: the conv-id→timeline resolver, the contactless
  identity/label on `timelines`, and the Pulse label/surface tweak.

### Acceptance criteria
- **AC1 (R1/R2):** Three inbound emails of ONE Yelp conversation arriving from three DIFFERENT
  `reply+<hex>@messaging.yelp.com` addresses all link to a SINGLE timeline (one row), resolved by the
  stable conv-id; a second conversation resolves to a DIFFERENT timeline.
- **AC2 (R3/R5):** Across those messages, no `contacts` row is created, `createEmailContact` is never
  called, and the no-contact Mail-Secretary branch never fabricates a contact. A Yelp email with no
  parseable conv-id (and a `no-reply@*yelp.com` confirmation) creates neither a timeline nor a contact.
- **AC3 (R4):** When the autoresponder lead path creates the lead (real name), a contact is created
  and the EXISTING conv-id timeline gains that `contact_id` — no second timeline appears for the
  conversation, and the total timeline count for that conversation stays 1.
- **AC4 (R6):** The contactless conv-id timeline appears in the Pulse unified list, labeled with the
  parsed customer name (not from a `contacts` row), and is openable; its ordering recency reflects its
  latest Yelp message.
- **AC5 (R7/N3):** Serving the Pulse list and the single timeline issues no relay-address parsing and
  no per-request grouping — the conv-id→timeline mapping is read by an indexed key; an `EXPLAIN` of the
  serve path shows the indexed lookup, not a scan/aggregate over messages.
- **AC6 (R9):** Re-ingesting an already-seen `provider_message_id` (push+poll overlap) adds no second
  link to the conv-id timeline and re-emits no unread/SSE, despite `contact_id` being NULL.
- **AC7 (R10):** A forced fault in conv-id parsing / timeline resolution leaves `linkInboundMessage`
  and the ingest pipeline running (the email flows through normally) and does NOT create a junk contact.
- **AC8 (R8):** Running the one-time cleanup on the 8 junk conversations consolidates each
  conversation's messages onto one timeline and deletes the junk contacts; a snapshot exists before the
  operation; the operation is confirmed by the owner and is not triggered by ingest.

### Out of scope
- The conversational booking agent itself (the LLM tool-loop, slot holds, phone handoff) — that is
  YELP-CONVO-BOOKING-001; this feature only unifies the timeline + suppresses the contact and does not
  change the agent's behavior.
- Non-default companies; SMS/voice channels; any browser automation, DNS, or GCP work.
- A general contact-dedupe/identity overhaul — this is Yelp-relay-scoped only.
- Backfilling historical Yelp messages beyond the one-time 8-conversation cleanup (R8).

### Involved modules (summary)
- **backend/src/services/email/emailTimelineService.js** — `linkInboundMessage`: the Yelp intercept
  (steps a.4/a.4b) must now LINK each Yelp message onto the conv-id timeline (contactless) instead of
  returning a bare `{skipped}` with no timeline, while STILL suppressing the contact + the
  Mail-Secretary review. Adapt the `alreadyLinked` idempotency read for a contactless link.
- **backend/src/services/yelpLeadService.js** — reuse `parseConversationId`; on the lead path, attach
  the created contact to the conv-id timeline (do not spin a new contact-keyed timeline).
- **backend/src/db/timelinesQueries.js** — new write-time resolver
  `findOrCreateTimelineBy…(convId, companyId)` (conv-id analogue of `findOrCreateTimelineByContact`/
  `findOrCreateAnonymousTimeline`); label/surface the contactless conv-id timeline in
  `getUnifiedTimelinePage`.
- **backend/src/db/emailQueries.js** — `linkMessageToContact`/`getMessageLinkState` used with
  `contact_id` NULL (contactless link) — idempotency keyed on timeline/message, not on a contact.
- **backend/db/migrations/** — additive migration: the conv-id anchor on `timelines` + widened
  identity CHECK + partial unique index `(company_id, yelp_conversation_id)` + any denormalized
  display-name column for the label (see B1/B3).
- **backend/src/db/yelpConversationQueries.js / `yelp_conversations`** — the existing conv-id store;
  candidate home for the conv-id ↔ timeline_id link (B1).
- **Pulse unified-list renderer** — render the customer-name label + surface for a contact-less row (B3).
- **backend/src/services/contactEmailMergeService.js / timelineMergeService.js** — reused by the
  one-time cleanup (R8) message-relink; the cleanup itself is a separate one-shot (script/migration-off).

### Affected integrations
- **Yelp email relay** (inbound only, the varying `reply+<hex>@` address is the thing being
  de-duplicated). **Gemini / greeting / slot engine:** untouched by this feature. **Twilio / Front /
  Zenbooker:** none.

### Protected code (MUST NOT break)
- `emailTimelineService.linkInboundMessage` ordering + fail-open contract — the Yelp intercept stays
  BEFORE the mute guard and BEFORE the no-contact Mail-Secretary branch; adding the contactless link
  must not change behavior for NON-Yelp mail (contact match, mute, Mail-Secretary, unread/AR/SSE all
  byte-for-byte unchanged).
- The normal per-contact timeline model — `findOrCreateTimelineByContact`, the `uq_timelines_contact`
  one-timeline-per-contact invariant, and the `getUnifiedTimelinePage` contact/SMS/call/email
  projections for existing rows stay unchanged; the conv-id path is additive.
- The `chk_timelines_identity` CHECK and the orphan-phone dedup (mig 029) — must remain valid for
  every existing row; any widening is additive (see B1).
- CONVO-BOOKING-001's `yelp_conversations` invariants and `parseConversationId` — reused, not
  re-shaped; the 002 `yelp_lead_events` idempotency ledger and the autoresponder short-circuit
  semantics for NON-timeline concerns stay intact.
- The single-reply-per-thread / at-most-one-greeting guards — untouched (this feature is inbound
  timeline unification, it sends nothing).

### ⚑ Boundaries / edge-cases for the Architect + Implementer to resolve
- **B1 — Timeline identity for a contactless conversation vs. the `chk_timelines_identity` CHECK.**
  Mig 029 constrains `CHECK (contact_id IS NOT NULL OR phone_e164 IS NOT NULL)` — a truly
  contact-less AND phone-less conv-id timeline VIOLATES it today; and `findOrCreateAnonymousTimeline`
  satisfies the CHECK only via a single shared `ANONYMOUS_PHONE_SENTINEL` bucket (one row for ALL
  anonymous activity — the wrong granularity, one-per-conversation is required). Resolve where the
  conv-id lives and how identity is satisfied: (a) add a `yelp_conversation_id` column on `timelines`
  + widen the CHECK to allow it as a third anchor + a partial UNIQUE `(company_id, yelp_conversation_id)`;
  vs. (b) hang `timeline_id` off the existing `yelp_conversations` row and keep `timelines` unaware;
  vs. (c) a per-conversation synthetic phone sentinel (DISCOURAGED — collides with phone semantics and
  the orphan-phone dedup). Pick the one that keeps resolution an indexed find-or-create (R7) and every
  existing row CHECK-valid (N4).
- **B2 — Resolver placement vs. the autoresponder short-circuit (the inversion).** TODAY the Yelp
  intercept returns `{skipped:'yelp_lead'}` / `{skipped:'yelp_convo'}` with NO link and NO timeline;
  this feature must turn that into "link this message onto the shared conv-id timeline (contactless) +
  STILL suppress the contact and the Mail-Secretary review." Resolve: does the contactless linker live
  inside `maybeHandleYelpLead`/`maybeHandleYelpReply`, or as a distinct linking step in
  `linkInboundMessage` that runs for any Yelp message the intercept recognizes? It must fire for BOTH
  the first message AND every reply, and — per the owner (the timeline is the deliverable, the greeting
  is secondary) — the unification must hold **even when the autoresponder greeting is disabled or
  failing** (`YELP_AUTORESPONDER_ENABLED` off / a handler fault). Decouple "unify the timeline" from
  "send the greeting."
- **B3 — Pulse visibility + label for a contact-less timeline (the hard one).**
  `getUnifiedTimelinePage` is contact-keyed in two ways: the display label is `to_json(co)` (NULL for a
  contactless row) and the email signal comes from the `email_by_contact` CTE joined on
  `contact_emails.contact_id` (contactless ⇒ no email signal); the surfacing WHERE requires one of
  call / SMS / email / `open_task.id` / `is_action_required` / `has_unread`; and the recency ORDER BY is
  `GREATEST(call, sms, email last_message_at)` → NULL for a contactless Yelp row. Resolve, at WRITE time
  (R7): (a) a customer-name label source that is NOT a `contacts` row — e.g. a denormalized
  `display_name`/`title` on `timelines` set from the parsed Yelp name (or a lead-name join); (b) a
  surfacing signal — set `has_unread`/`is_action_required` on the conv-id timeline and/or attach the
  `yelp_lead` task via `tasks.thread_id = timeline_id`; (c) a recency value so the row orders sanely;
  (d) confirm the orphan-shadow dedup (drops a `contact_id IS NULL` row only on a real phone-digit
  match) and the frontend timeline renderer both tolerate a contact-less, phone-less row.
- **B4 — No-conv-id / notification policy (R5).** Decide the exact treatment of a Yelp email with no
  parseable conv-id, and of `no-reply@*yelp.com` confirmations: drop as skipped-noise (no surface) vs. a
  single dedicated fallback bucket — but in NEITHER case create a contact or a per-message timeline.
  Confirm the confirmation mails (which are never intercepted and fall to the no-contact branch today)
  do not `createEmailContact`, and specify how conv-id parse-failure interacts with R10 fail-open
  WITHOUT re-enabling the junk-contact path.
- **B5 — Contactless-link idempotency (R9).** The current `alreadyLinked` guard in `linkInboundMessage`
  is `existing.on_timeline && existing.contact_id != null` — a contactless link has `contact_id` NULL,
  so the guard MISFIRES and the message re-processes (re-unread/re-SSE) on every re-delivery. Adapt the
  idempotency read to key on `timeline_id`/`on_timeline` (or `provider_message_id`) rather than a
  non-null contact, so push+poll overlap and retries stay exactly-once for a contactless conv-id link.
- **B6 — Contact-adopts-conv-id-timeline (R4) without a second timeline.** When the lead path later
  creates the real contact, attaching it must set `contact_id` on the EXISTING conv-id timeline, NOT
  route through `findOrCreateTimelineByContact` (which would mint a fresh contact-keyed row and re-split
  the conversation). Resolve the adopt/merge semantics so the conv-id timeline remains THE single
  timeline (now both conv-id AND contact anchored — check the CHECK + `uq_timelines_contact` still hold),
  the label flips to the contact name, and any already-linked messages stay put. Define what happens if
  a conv-id timeline and a pre-existing contact timeline for the same person must be merged (reuse
  `mergeOrphanTimelines`/`mergeContacts` relink).
- **B7 — One-time cleanup design (R8).** The 8 existing junk conversations were ingested BEFORE this
  fix, so their messages carry no conv-id link. Resolve: recover each message's conv-id (re-parse the
  stored bodies), snapshot the affected contacts + timelines + message-links first, produce an
  owner-confirmable conv-id ↔ messages mapping, then consolidate onto one timeline per conversation
  (reusing `linkInboxMessages`/`mergeOrphanTimelines` relink logic) and DELETE the junk contacts —
  noting this shape differs from `mergeContacts` (which merges a dup INTO a survivor contact; here the
  survivor is a CONTACTLESS conv-id timeline and the contacts are deleted). Keep it a separate,
  owner-run, snapshot-first, irreversible, default-company one-shot — not wired into ingest, not part of
  the additive schema migration.

## SCHED-ROUTE-VIS-001 — drive-time легсы в расписании без ручных drag-действий (recalc-хуки + lazy-on-read досев) + "Customer, City" на карточках расписания и в таблице Jobs (2026-07-11)

**Краткое описание:** SCHED-ROUTE-001 задеплоен, но легсы drive-time между последовательными работами техника почти никогда не видны — пересчёт маршрутов запускается ТОЛЬКО на drag reschedule/reassign в расписании, смену адреса и геокод; создание job с датой+техником, назначение/смена техника и смена даты из карточки Job пересчёт НЕ триггерят, бэкфилла нет (прод: 50 строк `schedule_route_segments` при 236 jobs/30д). Вторая проблема — карточки расписания не показывают город клиента: SQL селектит `j.city`, но `rowToScheduleItem` его не мапит, хотя фронт (`ScheduleItemCard` agenda-layout) уже готов рендерить "Customer, City". Диагноз верифицирован по коду и прод-БД — ground truth, не переоткрывать.

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. **Диспетчер планирует день:** создаёт job из карточки (или job приходит из ZB-sync) сразу с датой и техником, потом меняет техника через карточку Job — открывает Schedule и между соседними работами техника СРАЗУ видит drive-time легсы, без единого drag'а.
2. **Диспетчер открывает старую неделю:** легсов для этих дней никогда не считали — при чтении route-segments недостающие tech-day пары самозалечиваются (ставятся в очередь пересчёта), при следующем обновлении легсы на месте. Никакого крона, Google-квота не горит (кэш `route_calculation_cache`).
3. **Техник (мобильная agenda):** видит на карточке "Customer, City" и между работами — время в пути; сразу понимает географию дня.
4. **Диспетчер в desktop-таблице Jobs:** ячейка Customer показывает "Customer, City" одной строкой — видно географию без открытия карточки.

**FRs:**

- **FR-1 (recalc-хуки — легсы без drag'ов):** `recalcForJob` (существующий механизм SCHED-ROUTE-001) должен вызываться дополнительно при: (a) **создании job с датой+техником** — и человеком, и ZB-sync'ом; (b) **назначении/смене техника из карточки Job** (`reassignItem`); (c) **смене даты из карточки Job**. Сегодня он зовётся только из drag-путей расписания (`scheduleService.js:486,501`), `updateJobLocation` (`jobsService.js:1570`) и геокода (`agentHandlers.js:78`) — эти вызовы сохраняются как есть.
- **FR-2 (lazy-on-read досев, self-healing):** при `GET /api/schedule/route-segments` для видимого диапазона недостающие tech-day пары (день+техник, для которых сегментов нет, а ≥2 назначенных работ есть) ставятся в очередь пересчёта через **существующий** `agentWorker` (task kind `route_calc`) — НЕ синхронно в запросе. Пересчёт идёт через `route_calculation_cache` (Google Distance Matrix только на cache-miss). Ответ route-segments не ждёт пересчёта: отдаёт что есть, досеянное появится при следующем чтении. Дедупликация: одна и та же tech-day пара не плодит дубли задач в очереди. Cron-бэкфилл отвергнут владельцем — не предлагать.
- **FR-3 (город на карточках расписания):** `rowToScheduleItem` (scheduleService.js) мапит `row.city` → `city` в ScheduleItem (SQL уже селектит `j.city`). Карточки расписания показывают **"Customer, City"** в agenda-layout (фронт уже строит `nameCity=[customer_name, city].join(', ')` — заработает от одного поля) И в classic-layout (добавить тот же формат). Города нет → показывается только имя, никаких "—"/пустых хвостов с запятой.
- **FR-4 (desktop-таблица Jobs):** колонка Customer (`jobHelpers.tsx`) показывает "Customer, City" одной строкой; города нет → только имя.

**ACs:**
- **AC-1:** создание job с датой+техником (вручную и через ZB-sync), смена/назначение техника из карточки Job, смена даты из карточки Job — каждый путь приводит к появлению актуальных route-segments для затронутых tech-day пар (старый и новый день/техник при переносе).
- **AC-2:** открытие расписания на диапазон без сегментов ставит недостающие tech-day пары в очередь `route_calc`; повторное чтение возвращает легсы; повторные открытия того же диапазона НЕ создают дублей задач и не бьют Google на закэшированных парах.
- **AC-3:** drag reschedule/reassign, смена адреса и геокод продолжают триггерить пересчёт как раньше (регрессий SCHED-ROUTE-001 нет).
- **AC-4:** карточка расписания (agenda и classic) показывает "Customer, City"; job без города — только имя; `GET /api/schedule` отдаёт `city` в items.
- **AC-5:** desktop-таблица Jobs: ячейка Customer = "Customer, City" одной строкой; без города — только имя. Мобильная `JobMobileCard` побайтово не изменена.
- **AC-6:** при выборе нескольких техников легсы допустимо не показывать (текущее поведение пар сохраняется, не регрессия).
- **AC-7:** `npm run build` (tsc -b) green + backend jest green; НИКАКИХ новых миграций.

**Out-of-scope:**
- Cron/one-shot бэкфилл-сидер (отвергнут владельцем — self-healing через lazy-on-read достаточно).
- Traffic-aware ETA (`departure_time`) — остаётся driving-no-traffic как в SCHED-ROUTE-001.
- Мобильная `JobMobileCard` — уже корректна, НЕ трогать.
- Легсы при мульти-выборе техников; прод-деплой.

**Ограничения и нефункциональные требования:**
- **NO migrations** — таблицы `schedule_route_segments` / `route_calculation_cache` (миграции 119/120) уже существуют.
- Google-квоту не жечь: любой пересчёт идёт cache-first через `route_calculation_cache`; lazy-досев — только через очередь agentWorker, не синхронно в HTTP-запросе.
- `GET /api/schedule/route-segments` остаётся за пермишеном `schedule.view`; время ответа не деградирует (enqueue — fire-and-forget).
- Рендер-цепочка фронта (DayView mobile agenda, `routeByPair` в TimelineView/TimelineWeekView/ListView) уже работает — данные должны просто появиться; фронт-изменения только косметика "Customer, City".
- Мёртвый экспорт `routeQueries.getSeedTechDays` — можно использовать как основу досева или удалить, но не оставлять полу-живым.

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули:**
- `backend/src/services/scheduleService.js` — `rowToScheduleItem` (мапинг city), точки recalc.
- `backend/src/services/jobsService.js` — хуки на create-with-date+tech, `reassignItem`, смену даты.
- `backend/src/routes/schedule.js` (route-segments endpoint) — lazy-on-read enqueue.
- `backend/src/agent/…` (agentWorker, task kind `route_calc`) + `routeQueries` — досев tech-day пар.
- Zenbooker sync (job create/update path) — тот же recalc-хук, что и у человеческого создания.
- `frontend/src/components/schedule/ScheduleItemCard.tsx` (classic layout), `frontend/src/pages/jobs/jobHelpers.tsx` (колонка Customer).

**Затронутые интеграции:** Google (Distance Matrix — только cache-miss, ключ/поведение SCHED-ROUTE-001 без изменений); Zenbooker (job-sync получает recalc-хук, сам sync не меняется). Twilio / Front / Stripe / VAPI — нет.

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):**
- Существующие recalc-вызовы SCHED-ROUTE-001: `scheduleService.js:486,501` (drag reschedule/reassign), `jobsService.js:1570` (`updateJobLocation`), `agentHandlers.js:78` (геокод).
- `routeDistanceService` / `route_calculation_cache` семантика (driving, no traffic, cache-first, `NO_KEY` → fail-soft).
- `reassignItem` ZB write-through (assign/unassign diff в Zenbooker) — recalc-хук добавляется рядом, не внутрь диффа.
- agentWorker и существующие task kinds (`route_calc` очередь расширяется данными, не переписывается).
- Мобильная `JobMobileCard` и agenda-рендер `nameCity` в `ScheduleItemCard` — фронт agenda уже корректен.
- Пермишен-гейт `schedule.view` на route-segments; формат ответа route-segments (только досев, без ломки контракта).

## TECH-DAYOFF-001 — Day-off (time off) периоды техников: слот-движок и роботы перестают предлагать время, когда никто не работает (2026-07-11)

**Краткое описание:** Пустое расписание сегодня выглядит для слот-движка как «свободно», поэтому Sara (VAPI inbound), outbound parts-visit робот, Yelp-агент и слот-пикер UI бронируют клиентов на дни, когда никто не работает. Вводим сущность **day-off**: период от даты-времени до даты-времени (может пересекать полночь и несколько дней, пример: сб 9:00 → вс 21:00), привязанный к конкретному технику. Создать можно для одного техника ИЛИ «на всю компанию» — company-wide **материализуется** в отдельные записи на каждого активного техника (удаление всегда поштучное: удалил у одного — у остальных остаётся). Day-off блокирует ТОЛЬКО предложение слотов через единый seam `slotEngineService.recommendSlots`; ручные действия диспетчера получают предупреждение, но не блокируются.

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. **Диспетчер закрывает завтра всю компанию** (праздник/шторм): Schedule → «Time off» → период «завтра 00:00 → послезавтра 00:00», цель «Вся компания» → у каждого активного техника появляется своя запись day-off; ни один робот и слот-пикер не предложит завтра ни одного слота.
2. **Диспетчер оформляет отпуск одного техника:** выбирает техника, период «сб 9:00 → вс 21:00» → слот-движок исключает этого техника из кандидатов на пересечении, остальные техники предлагаются как обычно.
3. **Техник (provider) видит свой day-off:** в своём расписании (desktop timeline / мобильная agenda) видит серый блок «Time off» на своих днях — понимает, что на это время его не забронируют.
4. **Робот не предлагает мёртвые слоты:** Sara на входящем, outbound parts-visit агент и Yelp convo-агент — все идут через `recommendSlots` и просто не получают окон, пересекающихся с day-off; клиенту предлагаются только реально рабочие времена.
5. **Диспетчер вручную ставит работу на конфликт:** создаёт/переносит job на период day-off техника — видит явное ПРЕДУПРЕЖДЕНИЕ («у техника time off»), но может подтвердить и продолжить (ручное решение диспетчера — сильнее).

**FRs:**

- **FR-1 (сущность + миграция 167):** новая таблица day-off периодов (миграция **167** + rollback): `company_id`, `technician`(crm_user), `starts_at`/`ends_at` (timestamptz, `ends_at > starts_at`, период может пересекать полночь/несколько дней), `created_by` (= `req.user.crmUser.id`, НЕ sub). Тенант-скоуп по `company_id` обязателен.
- **FR-2 (company-wide материализация):** цель «вся компания» на create разворачивается сервером в N отдельных записей — по одной на каждого **активного** техника компании на момент создания. Никакой «групповой» записи не существует; техник, добавленный в компанию позже, записей задним числом не получает.
- **FR-3 (поштучное удаление):** удаление — всегда одной записи одного техника. Удаление записи, созданной company-wide действием, НЕ трогает записи остальных техников. Редактирования периода в v1 нет (создать/удалить).
- **FR-4 (единый seam слотов):** `slotEngineService.recommendSlots` исключает окна, пересекающиеся с day-off техника-кандидата (любое пересечение интервалов, включая частичное). Через этот seam автоматически закрываются ВСЕ потребители: Sara/VAPI inbound, outbound parts-visit (TECHSLOT), Yelp convo-агент, слот-пикер UI (CustomTimeModal / reschedule). Ни один потребитель не патчится отдельно.
- **FR-5 (warning, не блок):** ручное создание job / перенос (drag и из карточки) на период, пересекающийся с day-off назначенного техника, показывает диспетчеру предупреждение с именем техника и периодом, но позволяет продолжить. Никаких серверных 4xx-блокировок ручных действий.
- **FR-6 (UI управления):** страница Schedule → кнопка «Time off» → FORM-CANON панель (`DialogContent variant="panel"`, floating-label поля): создание (from/to datetime; цель — техник ИЛИ вся компания) + список текущих и будущих day-off с поштучным удалением. Прошедшие периоды в списке не показываются.
- **FR-7 (видимость в сетке):** desktop timeline-виды расписания рендерят day-off серыми блоками «Time off» на ленте соответствующего техника; мобильная agenda — по спеке (допустима упрощённая пометка дня/интервала).
- **FR-8 (RBAC):** CRUD day-off — за `schedule.dispatch`. Техник (роль provider, assigned_only scope) видит СВОИ блоки day-off в расписании, но не создаёт/не удаляет и не видит чужих в UI управления.

**ACs:**
- **AC-1:** company-wide create при K активных техниках создаёт ровно K записей; DELETE одной записи оставляет K-1 нетронутыми.
- **AC-2:** `recommendSlots` не возвращает ни одного окна, пересекающегося с day-off техника (полное и частичное пересечение, включая период через полночь/несколько дней); техники без day-off предлагаются как раньше (без day-off поведение движка байт-в-байт прежнее).
- **AC-3:** все роботы-потребители (Sara inbound, outbound parts-visit, Yelp convo) получают уже отфильтрованные слоты без изменения их собственного кода — фильтр живёт в seam.
- **AC-4:** ручное создание/перенос job на конфликтный период показывает предупреждение и по подтверждению сохраняет работу (не блокируется).
- **AC-5:** серые блоки «Time off» видны в desktop timeline-видах; provider видит только свои.
- **AC-6:** RBAC: без `schedule.dispatch` create/delete day-off → 403; provider получает свои блоки в данных расписания.
- **AC-7:** backend jest green + `npm run build` (tsc -b) green; миграция 167 + rollback применяются чисто.

**Out-of-scope:**
- Zenbooker availability / любой ZB write-through — day-off НЕ уезжает в Zenbooker.
- Повторяющиеся (recurring) day-off — только разовые периоды.
- Редактирование периода — v1 = создать/удалить.
- Авто-разрешение конфликтов с УЖЕ назначенными на период работами (не переносим, не оповещаем) — только warning при новых ручных действиях.
- Прод-деплой (по правилу deploy-consent — только по явному «да» владельца).

**Ограничения и нефункциональные требования:**
- Фильтр — только в `slotEngineService.recommendSlots` (CRM-сторона seam); сам standalone slot-engine контейнер не трогаем, если требование закрывается на стороне CRM.
- Пересечение интервалов считать по timestamptz (таймзона компании учитывается при вводе в UI, хранение — UTC).
- Панель «Time off» — строго FORM-CANON (`docs/specs/FORM-CANON.md`): panel-шторка, floating labels, на мобиле авто bottom-sheet.
- Списки/сетка не деградируют по времени ответа: day-off читается одним запросом на видимый диапазон.

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули:**
- `backend/db/migrations/167_*.sql` (+ rollback) — таблица day-off.
- `backend/src/services/slotEngineService.js` — фильтр в `recommendSlots` (единый seam).
- `backend/src/routes/schedule.js` + `backend/src/services/scheduleService.js` — CRUD day-off, отдача блоков в данные расписания, warning-проверка конфликта.
- `backend/src/services/permissionCatalog.js` / `authorizationService.js` — гейт `schedule.dispatch`, provider-scope на свои блоки.
- `frontend/src/pages/SchedulePage.tsx` + `frontend/src/components/schedule/*` — кнопка «Time off», FORM-CANON панель, серые блоки в timeline-видах.
- Слот-пикер UI (CustomTimeModal / reschedule-модалка) — получает фильтрацию бесплатно через recommendSlots; warning при ручном выборе конфликтного времени.

**Затронутые интеграции:** нет напрямую (Twilio/Front/Stripe — нет). VAPI/Sara, outbound parts-visit, Yelp-агент затрагиваются только через seam recommendSlots (их код не меняется). Zenbooker — явно out-of-scope.

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):**
- Поведение `recommendSlots` при отсутствии day-off — байт-в-байт прежнее (Tier-1/Tier-2 fallback, TECHSLOT one-tech логика, slot-persist path для vapi-tools).
- `reassignItem` ZB write-through и recalc-хуки SCHED-ROUTE-001/VIS-001 — warning добавляется рядом, не внутрь.
- FSM job/lead переходов и task-механика outbound parts-visit (CANCEL-001) — не трогаем.
- RBAC-каталог: существующие ключи пермишенов не переименовываются; `schedule.view` продолжает гейтить чтение расписания.
- Drag-DnD расписания и мобильная agenda-рендер-цепочка — day-off блоки добавляются как отдельный слой данных, не ломая items.

## ONBOARDING-UX-001 — человечный онбординг новых компаний: hub-страница /welcome, чеклист из 4 шагов, trial-информер, redesign connect-форм маркетплейса (2026-07-12)

**Краткое описание:** Расширение ONBTEL-001 Part A. Новая компания после signup попадает не на пустой /pulse, а на тёплую hub-страницу `/welcome` (tenant_admin only) с прогрессом «N of M», обещанием «about 3 minutes» и карточками шагов. Чеклист расширяется с 1 до 4 derived-шагов (company_profile, connect_telephony, connect_email, stripe_payments), появляется trial-информер (не шаг), а все setup-страницы маркетплейса подтягиваются к эталону Stripe (STRIPE-CONNECT-UX-001): CloudBanner hero + человечная английская копия.

**Решения заказчика (БИНДИНГ, не менять):**
1. Hub `/welcome` — новый route, tenant_admin only; hero на `CloudBanner` (violet-cloud, эталон `StripePaymentsSettingsPage.tsx:142`); прогресс «N of M»; обещание «about 3 minutes»; карточки шагов с time-estimate; тёплый completion-экран при 100% БЕЗ конфетти-перегруза (канон запрещает декоративный шум).
2. Первый вход новой компании после `bootstrapCompany` редиректит на `/welcome` вместо `/pulse` (`onboarding.js:85` redirect + фронт).
3. Карточка на /pulse (`OnboardingChecklistCard.tsx`) становится КОМПАКТНЫМ трекером прогресса и ведёт на `/welcome`.
4. Шаги чеклиста — расширить data-driven реестр `CHECKLIST_ITEMS`; статусы derived, `completed_at` write-once — семантику НЕ менять:
   - `company_profile` — done ⇔ профиль компании заполнен (деривация выбирается архитектором по факту хранения);
   - `connect_telephony` — существующий (`phone_number_settings` ≥ 1);
   - `connect_email` — done ⇔ gmail mailbox `provider='gmail' AND status='connected'`;
   - `stripe_payments` — done ⇔ Stripe integration `connected_ready`.
5. Trial-информер — НЕ шаг: «X days left on trial» из `billing_subscriptions` (`status='trialing'`, `trial_ends_at`) с CTA на `/settings/billing`; в прогрессе не участвует. `GET /api/onboarding/checklist` расширяется аддитивно, НЕ ломая существующий контракт.
6. Redesign ВСЕХ setup-страниц к уровню эталона Stripe: GoogleEmailSettingsPage, TelephonyTwilioSettingsPage (степпер уже есть — полировка копии/hero), Vapi AI, Mail Secretary, а также generic `MarketplaceConnectDialog` (IntegrationsPage) — через него подключаются Smart Slot Engine и AI Repair Advisor (отдельных setup-страниц у них НЕТ — установлено при обследовании кода).
7. Копия UI — английская, тёплая, человечная («You're 3 minutes away from your first call», «Nice — your phone line is live!»). Слово «Blanc» в UI запрещено (продукт = Albusto).
8. Существующие компании с уже установленным `completed_at` НЕ ресурфейсим (write-once остаётся). Не-админ ничего из этого не видит (существующий gate `isTenantAdmin` + `checklist.visible`).
9. Mobile: канон (panel→bottom-sheet автоматически, hub-страница адаптивная).

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. Владелец только что создал компанию (signup → OTP → company) → попадает на `/welcome`: hero «Welcome to Albusto», «0 of 4 done», четыре карточки шагов с оценкой времени, блок «14 days left on your trial». Жмёт карточку Telephony → уходит в существующий Twilio-визард → возвращается → шаг отмечен done, прогресс «1 of 4».
2. Tenant_admin заходит на /pulse с незавершённым чеклистом → видит компактный трекер прогресса («Finish setting up · 2 of 4 done») → клик ведёт на `/welcome`.
3. Все 4 шага выполнены → `completed_at` фиксируется write-once (существующая семантика) → карточка на /pulse исчезает навсегда; прямой заход на `/welcome` показывает тёплый completion-экран с CTA «Go to Pulse».
4. Диспетчер/провайдер (не tenant_admin) — не видит ни карточку, ни данных чеклиста; прямой заход на `/welcome` уводит на /pulse; API отвечает 403.
5. Компания в trial видит на `/welcome` информер «X days left on your trial» с CTA «View plans» → /settings/billing; компания на платном плане/без подписки информера не видит.
6. Владелец открывает любую setup-страницу маркетплейса (Google Email, Vapi AI, Mail Secretary, Stripe, Telephony) в неподключённом состоянии → видит CloudBanner hero с человечным объяснением ценности и понятным CTA, а не сухую техническую форму.

**Ограничения и нефункциональные требования:**
- Семантика `completed_at` (write-once, только внутри GET, guarded UPDATE «only if NULL») — НЕ меняется; новые шаги у уже «завершённых» компаний карточку не воскрешают.
- Контракт `GET /api/onboarding/checklist` расширяется строго аддитивно (`visible`, `completed_at`, `items[]` с прежними полями сохраняются байт-в-байт).
- Ошибка чтения trial-данных не валит чеклист (информер опционален — деградация в `trial: null`).
- Никаких новых миграций: все деривации читают существующие таблицы; `companies.settings` JSONB уже есть.
- Никаких мутационных endpoints у чеклиста (по-прежнему GET-only).
- Копия — только английская; строка «Blanc» в UI-строках запрещена.
- Derived-статусы не должны звать внешние API (Stripe/Google) — только локальные таблицы.

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули/части системы:**
- Backend: `backend/src/services/onboardingChecklistService.js` (реестр + деривации), `backend/src/routes/onboarding.js` (redirect + ответ), `backend/src/services/billingService.js` (getSubscription — читаем, не меняем), `backend/src/services/emailMailboxService.js`, `backend/src/services/stripePaymentsService.js` (читаем).
- Frontend: `frontend/src/pages/WelcomePage.tsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/App.tsx` (route), `frontend/src/components/onboarding/OnboardingChecklistCard.tsx`, `frontend/src/hooks/useOnboardingChecklist.ts`, `frontend/src/services/onboardingApi.ts`, `frontend/src/pages/{GoogleEmailSettingsPage,TelephonyTwilioSettingsPage,VapiSettingsPage,MailSecretarySettingsPage,IntegrationsPage}.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/ui/CloudBanner.tsx` (реюз, не менять).
- Затронутые интеграции: Twilio (косвенно — существующий шаг), Gmail/Google OAuth (derived-статус), Stripe (derived-статус). Front/Zenbooker — нет.

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):**
- Write-once `markCompleted` и visibility-машина `getChecklist` (onboardingChecklistService.js:65-133) — семантика неизменна, только аддитивные поля.
- `POST /api/onboarding` (создание компании, OTP, trust-device) — меняется ТОЛЬКО значение поля `redirect`.
- Middleware-цепочка `/checklist` (requireCompanyAccess + inline requireTenantAdmin) и company_id ТОЛЬКО из `req.companyFilter`.
- `src/server.js`, `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`, `frontend/src/hooks/useRealtimeEvents.ts`, `backend/db/` — не трогать.
- `CloudBanner.tsx` / `.blanc-cloud` (design-system.css:826-857) — реюз как есть.
- Функциональность существующих setup-страниц (mutations, статусы, wizard-логика TelephonyTwilio) — redesign только представления и копии.

## TIMELINE-REVPAGE-001 — messenger-style Pulse conversation timeline: reverse cursor pagination (20-item merged batches), bottom-anchored open, scroll-up history, sticky Action-Required bar (2026-07-13)

**Status:** Requirements (Product/Agent-01). NEW feature. Dedup checked: no prior timeline-detail pagination feature exists; **LIST-PAGINATION-001** covers ONLY the LEFT unified list (`getUnifiedTimelinePage`) — this feature is the RIGHT conversation feed (timeline detail) and does not touch the list SQL. Owner interview done; binding decisions 1–6 below. **Pipeline mode: auto-run; implementation delegated to the GPT-implementer** (Claude = architect/reviewer, ONBOARDING-UX-001 precedent).

**Priority:** P1 — UX + performance. Today the thread feed loads the ENTIRE history (calls query has NO LIMIT with heavy recording/transcript LATERAL joins; SMS 200-per-conversation across all matched conversations; ALL estimates+invoices; all timeline emails) on every open AND on every SSE event, and renders oldest→newest top-down — long threads scroll forever and re-fetch everything constantly.

**Краткое описание / Description:** Rework the Pulse conversation timeline to messenger behavior (WhatsApp/Telegram). The unified feed (calls + SMS + emails + financial events, merged) is paginated ONLY newest→oldest in batches of **20 merged items** with an opaque cursor (not by days, not by offset). Opening a thread lands at the BOTTOM — newest items and the reply composer visible. Scrolling UP loads older batches with scroll-position preservation. New inbound while the user is scrolled up does NOT yank the scroll — a "Jump to latest" pill appears; auto-stick to bottom only when the user is already at/near the bottom. The Action-Required bar becomes sticky at the top of the right column; the Lead/Contact card stays above the feed. Live SSE updates refresh ONLY the newest page instead of reloading the whole history.

**Binding owner decisions (НЕ менять):**
1. Pipeline: auto-run; implementation by the GPT-implementer.
2. New inbound while scrolled up → NO auto-scroll; show a "Jump to latest" pill; auto-stick only when already at/near the bottom.
3. Action-Required bar → STICKY at the top of the right column (always visible while the thread has an open task). Lead/Contact card stays ABOVE the feed, reachable by scrolling up.
4. Batch size = **20 merged items**.
5. On open: land at the bottom (latest items + composer visible).
6. Other timeline consumers stay untouched: `GET /api/pulse/timeline-by-phone` (softphone widget, AppLayout) and the legacy ConversationPage.

**Verified code facts (carry forward; do NOT re-discover):**
- Backend `backend/src/routes/pulse.js`: `GET /api/pulse/timeline-by-id/:timelineId` (:57) and `GET /api/pulse/timeline/:contactId` (:94) share `buildTimeline()`: calls query has NO LIMIT (`ORDER BY started_at DESC`, heavy LATERAL joins for recording/transcript); SMS = per-conversation `convQueries.getMessages(conv.id, {limit:200})` across `sms_conversations` matched by phone digits; financial events = ALL estimates+invoices (gated by `financial_data.view`); emails via `emailQueries.getTimelineEmailByContact/getTimelineEmailByTimeline` (quote-strip `toTimelineBody`). Response: `{calls, messages, conversations, email_messages, financial_events, timeline_id, display_name, external_source, contact}`. All Pulse routes require `pulse.view`; provider `assigned_only` scoping via `isContactVisibleToProvider`; tenant via `req.companyFilter?.company_id`.
- Frontend: `frontend/src/hooks/usePulseTimeline.ts` (React Query, key `['pulse-timeline', mode, key]`, staleTime 30s) → `usePulsePage.ts` decomposes the arrays; `frontend/src/components/pulse/PulseTimeline.tsx` merges the 4 arrays client-side, sorts ASCENDING, renders ALL items with `DateSeparator` per company-tz day (:133), and has a fixed "Jump to latest" band-aid button (:169-183). Scroll container = `.pulse-right-column` (`PulsePage.tsx:264`) containing: AR-bar card (:279) → LeadCard/ContactCard/CreateLeadJobWizard → PulseTimeline → SmsForm (composer, bottom). Mobile uses the SAME column in the 'content' panel.
- SSE: `usePulsePage` `onCallUpdate`/`onMessageAdded`/`onTranscriptFinalized` → `refetchTimeline()` = full invalidate+refetch of the ONE query (i.e., full-history reload on every event today).
- Consumer check (verified this session): `pulseApi.getTimeline/getTimelineById` have exactly ONE consumer — `usePulseTimeline` → `usePulsePage` (Pulse page). `ContactDetailPanel` only navigates to the `/pulse/timeline/:id` ROUTE; the native tech app does not call `/api/pulse/timeline*`. `timeline-by-phone` is a separate route. So the two detail endpoints may be evolved for pagination without breaking outside consumers.

**User Scenarios:**
- **SC-01 (open long thread):** Dispatcher opens a thread with 500+ items → the feed shows the newest 20 items anchored to the bottom, composer visible without scrolling; the AR bar (if an open task exists) is pinned at the top of the column. No multi-second full-history load.
- **SC-02 (read history):** Dispatcher scrolls up → a compact spinner appears at the top of the feed, the next older batch of 20 prepends, and the items under the cursor DO NOT jump; repeated scrolling walks back through history until it is exhausted, after which the Lead/Contact card above the feed is reachable.
- **SC-03 (new inbound while reading history):** While the dispatcher is scrolled up reading old messages, a new SMS arrives → the reading position does not move; the "Jump to latest" pill lights up with a new-activity indication; clicking it jumps to the bottom showing the new message.
- **SC-04 (at the bottom):** Dispatcher is at/near the bottom when a new item arrives (inbound SMS, live robot-call row, email) → the feed auto-sticks and scrolls to show it.
- **SC-05 (send):** Dispatcher sends an SMS/email from the composer → the feed jumps to the bottom and the just-sent message is visible.
- **SC-06 (short thread):** A thread with 7 items total → all 7 render, no pagination affordances (no top spinner/sentinel), still bottom-anchored, composer visible.
- **SC-07 (restricted users):** A user without `financial_data.view` sees pages of 20 items with financial events excluded entirely (no gaps, no short pages); a provider with `assigned_only` scope gets the same 403/404 semantics as today.
- **SC-08 (mobile):** Same behaviors (bottom-anchored open, scroll-up paging, pill, auto-stick, sticky AR bar) in the mobile 'content' panel.

**Functional Requirements:**

*Backend — paged unified feed:*
- **FR-01 (reverse cursor page contract):** The Pulse conversation feed is served in pages of the MERGED stream (calls + SMS + emails + financial events) ordered newest→oldest, batch size = **20 merged items**. Pagination is cursor-based over a **strict total order** (item timestamp + deterministic tiebreaker, e.g., type+id — architect encodes it as an opaque cursor), NOT offset-based and NOT day-based. First request (no cursor) returns the newest 20; each response carries the next cursor + a `has_more` flag. Because new items land only at the newest end, previously issued cursors stay valid under live inserts (no page shifting).
- **FR-02 (page invariants — LIST-PAGINATION-001 discipline):** Merging, permission filtering (`financial_data.view`) and tenant/provider scoping are decided BEFORE the 20-cut: a page always contains exactly 20 items visible to THIS user (fewer only on the final oldest page); a page is never shrunk post-query; the strict total order guarantees no skipped and no duplicated items across page boundaries, including equal-timestamp runs.
- **FR-03 (bounded per-page work):** A page request performs bounded work: call enrichment (recording/transcript LATERAL joins), SMS reads, email projection (quote-strip `toTimelineBody`), and estimate/invoice reads are limited to the page window — no full-history scan+merge per request. Exact SQL strategy (per-source windowed queries vs. UNION spine, etc.) = architect's choice.
- **FR-04 (both identities, contactless included):** Pagination works for both entries — contact-keyed (`/timeline/:contactId`) and timeline-keyed (`/timeline-by-id/:timelineId`) — including contactless email-only timelines (YELP-TIMELINE-DEDUP-001), where the stream is the email leg only.
- **FR-05 (thread meta once):** Thread-level meta (`timeline_id`, `display_name`, `external_source`, `contact`, `conversations` — the composer needs the latter) remains available on open WITHOUT being recomputed on every older page (page-1 payload or a separate meta call — architect's choice). Contract evolution must keep decision 6 intact: `timeline-by-phone` byte-unchanged; legacy ConversationPage untouched.
- **FR-06 (permissions & tenancy unchanged):** `pulse.view` still gates all Pulse routes; `financial_data.view` still gates financial events (absent → excluded from the stream); provider `assigned_only` scoping via `isContactVisibleToProvider` unchanged; `company_id` strictly from `req.companyFilter?.company_id` on EVERY leg of the new SQL (the LIST-PAGINATION-001 cross-tenant SMS leak is the cautionary precedent).

*Frontend — messenger behavior:*
- **FR-07 (bottom-anchored open):** Opening a thread lands at the bottom: newest items + composer visible with zero scrolling; the initial loading state is preserved; the feed must not visibly render top-anchored and then snap down.
- **FR-08 (scroll-up loads older):** A top sentinel/threshold triggers loading of the next older batch; a compact spinner row shows at the TOP of the feed while loading; at most ONE older-page request in flight; on arrival the batch prepends with **scroll-position preservation** (previously visible items do not move on screen); repeats until `has_more=false`. Once history is exhausted, the Lead/Contact card (and CreateLeadJobWizard where applicable) above the feed becomes reachable by continuing to scroll up (decision 3).
- **FR-09 (date separators per day, batch-boundary correct):** `DateSeparator` per company-tz day is preserved, computed over the loaded window; prepending a batch must not duplicate or misplace separators — a day's separator always sits above the OLDEST loaded item of that day and moves up as older items of the same day load in.
- **FR-10 (live SSE scope = newest page):** SSE handlers (`onCallUpdate`, `onMessageAdded`, `onTranscriptFinalized`) refresh ONLY the newest page (append/update of newest items); loaded older pages stay in memory untouched — the current full invalidate+refetch of the whole history is removed for the Pulse feed. The in-place transcript patch (`finalizeTranscript`) and the live robot-call row lifecycle (OUTBOUND-CALL-TIMELINE-001: placement→live→finalize) keep working. Accepted v1 limitation: a server-side change to an item living only in an older loaded page may stay stale until the thread is reopened.
- **FR-11 (auto-stick + Jump-to-latest pill):** At/near the bottom (small threshold) when new items arrive → auto-stick (feed follows). Scrolled up → NO auto-scroll (decision 2); a floating "Jump to latest" pill is shown whenever the user is away from the bottom and lights up with a new-activity indication when items arrive meanwhile; click → jump to the bottom of the newest page and clear the indication. The pill REPLACES the existing fixed band-aid button (`PulseTimeline.tsx:169-183`) — exactly one such affordance remains.
- **FR-12 (send → bottom):** Sending from the composer (SMS or email channel) refreshes the newest page and scrolls the feed to the bottom so the sent message is visible.
- **FR-13 (sticky Action-Required bar):** The AR bar (Action Required/Snoozed state, reason, task text / Mail-Secretary agent reason, action buttons incl. OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-BTN) becomes sticky at the top of the right column — always visible while the thread has an open task, regardless of feed scroll (decision 3). All current AR content and actions are preserved byte-for-byte in behavior; when no open task exists, nothing renders (unchanged). Sticky layering respects the overlay canon (never paints over dialogs/sheets/bottom-sheets).
- **FR-14 (empty/short histories):** Total items < 20 (`has_more=false` on page 1) → the whole feed renders with NO pagination UI (no sentinel, no spinner row); zero items → current empty-feed behavior; in both cases card + composer render as today.
- **FR-15 (mobile parity):** All behaviors above work identically in the mobile 'content' panel (same `.pulse-right-column`), including iOS momentum scrolling; no separate mobile data path. The mobile list⇄content panel switching stays untouched.

**Non-functional requirements:**
- **N1 (performance):** Newest-page open on the heaviest prod thread must be decisively faster than today's full-history load and never worse; older-page fetches similar. `EXPLAIN` the new page query against a prod-DB copy (PULSE-PERF-001 discipline). An **index-only** migration is permitted if EXPLAIN demands it; no schema/data reshaping.
- **N2 (real-browser verification):** Bottom-anchor open, prepend scroll-preservation, auto-stick threshold, pill, sticky AR bar verified in a REAL browser (live preview), desktop + mobile 375px — house lesson: real-component preview catches what synthetic repros/specs miss.
- **N3 (real-DB verification):** Mocked jest is NOT enough (LIST-PAGINATION-001 lesson): run the real page query against a prod-DB copy covering — page boundary on an equal-timestamp run, user without `financial_data.view` (still 20/page), provider `assigned_only`, contactless email-only timeline, cross-tenant isolation, thread with exactly 20 / fewer than 20 / zero items. Backend jest green + `npm run build` (tsc -b) green.

**Constraints & Dependencies:**
- Composes with (per-item content unchanged): EMAIL-TIMELINE-001 / EMAIL-HTML-RENDER-001 / EMAIL-QUOTE-STRIP-001 (email items + `toTimelineBody`/`body_html`), OUTBOUND-CALL-TIMELINE-001 (robot-call live rows), YELP-TIMELINE-DEDUP-001 (contactless timelines must paginate), AR-TASK-UNIFY + MAIL-AGENT-001 + OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-BTN-001 (AR bar content/actions), LIST-PAGINATION-001 (invariants precedent; its left-list SQL untouched).
- **Item DTO parity:** per-item shapes stay compatible with the existing bubbles (`PulseCallListItem`/`SmsListItem`/`EmailListItem`/financial rows) — additive-only changes; no bubble redesign.
- Accepted consequence of decision 3: in long threads, reaching the Lead/Contact card requires paging up through history; the sticky AR bar is the always-visible action surface precisely for that reason.
- UI copy English; no "Blanc" in UI strings (product = Albusto); design tokens only (no hardcoded hex outside `--blanc-*`).
- Prod deploy ONLY on the owner's explicit «да» (standing deploy-consent rule).

**Out of scope (non-goals):**
- `GET /api/pulse/timeline-by-phone` and the softphone widget / AppLayout paths that use it — byte-untouched (decision 6).
- Legacy `ConversationPage` and its components — untouched (decision 6).
- The Pulse LEFT list and `getUnifiedTimelinePage` — untouched.
- No timeline search, no deep links/permalinks to an item, no jump-to-date.
- No unread divider ("New messages" line) — the pill is the only new-activity affordance.
- No virtualization (windowed DOM) — v1 lets loaded pages accumulate in the DOM.
- No new item types, no bubble/content redesign, no composer rework beyond the post-send scroll/refresh.
- No changes to SSE event EMISSION (names/payloads) — consumption scope on the Pulse page only.
- No prod deploy inside this feature (owner-gated).

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули:**
- `backend/src/routes/pulse.js` — `buildTimeline` → paged variant for the two detail endpoints (`/timeline/:contactId`, `/timeline-by-id/:timelineId`).
- `backend/db/*` — page-window variants of the calls / SMS (`convQueries.getMessages`) / email (`emailQueries.getTimelineEmailBy*`) / estimates+invoices reads; possible index-only migration.
- `frontend/src/hooks/usePulseTimeline.ts` (single query → cursor/infinite pages), `frontend/src/hooks/usePulsePage.ts` (SSE refetch scope, send handler), `frontend/src/services/pulseApi.ts` + `frontend/src/types/pulse.ts` (page contract).
- `frontend/src/components/pulse/PulseTimeline.tsx` (windowed merge, separators across batches, top sentinel/spinner, pill, bottom anchoring, prepend scroll-preservation), `frontend/src/pages/PulsePage.tsx` + pulse CSS (`.pulse-right-column` scroll model, sticky AR bar).

**Затронутые интеграции:** none directly — Twilio / Front / Zenbooker / Stripe / Gmail APIs untouched (financial events and emails are read from local tables as today); VAPI robot calls appear only via the existing SSE/timeline rows. This is a read-path + frontend UX feature.

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):**
- `GET /api/pulse/timeline-by-phone` (route + response) and its consumers: softphone widget (`useSoftPhoneWidget.ts`, `OpenTimelineButton.tsx`), `AppLayout.tsx` — byte-unchanged.
- Legacy `ConversationPage.tsx` + `components/conversations/*` — untouched.
- `getUnifiedTimelinePage` (left list SQL, LIST-PAGINATION-001/PULSE-PERF-001) — shape/semantics/plan unchanged.
- Item formatters' existing fields — `formatCall` (incl. `gemini_summary`, `playback_url`, `answered_by`), email `toTimelineBody`/`body_html` projection, financial event fields — additive-only.
- Permission gates: `pulse.view` route gate, `financial_data.view` financial gating, `isContactVisibleToProvider` provider scoping; `company_id` only from `req.companyFilter`.
- Composer paths: `SmsForm.tsx` channel routing ("To" phones+emails), `handleSendMessage` SMS/email send flows; `CreateLeadJobWizard`, `LeadCard`/`ContactCard` rendering.
- SSE plumbing: `useRealtimeEvents.ts`, `authedFetch.ts`, sseManager event names/payloads (`call.updated`, `message.added`, `transcript.finalized`) — only their consumption scope on the Pulse page changes.
- AR bar content/actions (AR-TASK-UNIFY, MAIL-AGENT-001 reason block, task action buttons) — presentation becomes sticky; behavior identical.
- Mobile panel switching (list⇄content) and the softphone-disabled-on-mobile behavior — untouched.

## SERVICE-TERR-002 — территория обслуживания v2: radius-режим с картой, единый containment-seam, онбординг-шаг service_territory (2026-07-13)

**Краткое описание:** Вторая итерация Service Territories. К существующему list-режиму (CSV/зипы, таблица `service_territories`) добавляется radius-режим: пары «зип + радиус в милях» вокруг базы компании, с read-only картой покрытия (круги/маркеры Google Maps). Появляется единый серверный containment-seam `isZipInTerritory(companyId, query)`, через который начинают ходить ВСЕ потребители зип-проверки (zip-check UI, Sara/VAPI/Yelp через skill checkServiceArea). Шаг онбординга `company_profile` ЗАМЕНЯЕТСЯ шагом `service_territory`. Страница `/settings/service-territories` чинится на мобильной вёрстке (375px).

**Решения заказчика (БИНДИНГ, не менять):**
1. Онбординг: в `CHECKLIST_ITEMS` шаг `company_profile` заменяется шагом `service_territory` («Set up your service territory», тёплая описка в тоне остальных, CTA Set up → `/settings/service-territories`, est_minutes 2). Профильный шаг УДАЛЯЕТСЯ (чеклист остаётся из 4 шагов, не 5). Иконка шага на /welcome — MapPin (lucide).
2. `/settings/service-territories` — два режима, активен ровно один (toggle сверху): **List** (существующий, функционал сохранить: CSV upload, add zip, export, список) и **Radius** (новый: пары «зип + радиус (miles)», первая пара = база компании, можно добавлять несколько пар и удалять их; зип вводится ТОЛЬКО инпутом). Переключение режимов в любой момент; данные ОБОИХ режимов сохраняются независимо (ничего не стирается); активный режим — отдельное поле хранения.
3. Карта Google — строго read-only (никакого взаимодействия): radius-режим — круги (`google.maps.Circle`) по центрам зипов; list-режим — маркеры центроидов зипов, у которых есть геокод (fit bounds). Паттерн — JobMap из `CustomTimeModal.tsx` (refs, Marker, LatLngBounds); loader `frontend/src/utils/loadGoogleMaps.ts`; Circle используется впервые.
4. Хранение — миграция 168 (+ rollback): `company_territory_settings` (company_id PK, active_mode 'list'|'radius' DEFAULT 'list'), `territory_radii` (id, company_id, zip, lat, lon, radius_miles CHECK >0 AND ≤200, position, created_at), `zip_geocache` (zip PK, lat, lon, city, state, geocoded_at — БЕЗ company_id, география глобальна). `service_territories` НЕ трогаем. `dim_zip` НЕ использовать (легаси, 5 строк на проде).
5. Геокод зипа — только серверный: `territoryGeoService.geocodeZip(zip)` — zip_geocache-first, миссы через Google Geocoding (ключ `GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY || GOOGLE_GEOCODING_KEY`, подход как в googlePlacesService). Ошибка геокода → 422 `ZIP_NOT_FOUND`, пара не добавляется.
6. Containment — ЕДИНЫЙ seam `isZipInTerritory(companyId, query)`: list → текущий `stQueries.search`; radius → геокод зипа (кэш) + haversine (мили, хелпера в кодовой базе нет — написать) против всех territory_radii; вернуть `{inside, area}` (radius: area = зип центра ближайшего покрывающего круга). Перевести на seam: `routes/zip-check.js` и `agentSkills/skills/checkServiceArea.js` (vapi-tools проверен — ходит через skill, напрямую stQueries не зовёт).
7. API под `/api/settings/service-territories` (существующий mount: authenticate + requirePermission('tenant.company.manage') + requireCompanyAccess; company_id ТОЛЬКО из `req.companyFilter`): `GET /config`, `PUT /mode`, `POST /radii` (геокод внутри), `DELETE /radii/:id`. Существующие endpoints list-режима не трогаем.
8. Онбординг-деривация: `service_territory` done ⇔ (mode=list AND EXISTS service_territories) OR (mode=radius AND EXISTS territory_radii).
9. Мобильная вёрстка страницы: на 375px всё читается; таблица → карточки или overflow-x-auto; кнопки переносятся аккуратно; header по канону.

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. Новый владелец на /welcome видит шаг «Set up your service territory» → CTA ведёт на `/settings/service-territories` → добавляет базовый зип + радиус 25 миль → видит круг на карте → шаг в чеклисте становится done.
2. Владелец существующей компании (list-режим, зипы загружены CSV) переключает toggle на Radius, добавляет пары; передумав, возвращается на List — все зипы на месте, поведение zip-check вернулось к прежнему.
3. Клиент звонит Sara и называет зип: checkServiceArea теперь отвечает по активному режиму — в radius-режиме зип в 20 милях от базы (радиус 25) считается in-area, area = зип базы.
4. Диспетчер на `/pulse` пользуется zip-check-полем: в radius-режиме ввод зипа геокодится (из кэша) и проверяется по кругам; город/штат берутся из zip_geocache.
5. Владелец добавляет пару с опечаткой в зипе → сервер не находит геокод → 422 ZIP_NOT_FOUND → тёплый toast, пара не добавлена.
6. Field-tech открывает страницу на телефоне (375px): режимы, список пар, карта и таблица зипов читаются без горизонтального скролла страницы.

**Ограничения и нефункциональные требования:**
- Поведение list-режима БАЙТ-В-БАЙТ прежнее: пока active_mode='list' (в т.ч. когда строки company_territory_settings нет — дефолт), zip-check и checkServiceArea отвечают ровно как сейчас (тот же stQueries.search, те же frozen-шейпы ответов).
- Frozen-шейпы потребителей сохраняются: skill checkServiceArea → `{inServiceArea, area, city, state, zip}` (без ok/speak — AC-11 AGENT-SKILLS-001); zip-check → `{ok, data:{success, exists, area, city, state, zip}}`.
- Google Geocoding зовётся ТОЛЬКО на промахе кэша и только на сервере; ключ не уходит в браузер (карта фронта — отдельный VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, как в JobMap).
- Никаких вызовов внешних API в онбординг-деривации (только локальные таблицы).
- `normalizeZip` применяется на всех входах зипа (leading-zero gotcha Бостона).
- Тесты 401/403 + tenant isolation для новых endpoints обязательны; DELETE чужого radius id → 404.

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули/части системы:**
- Backend: `backend/db/migrations/168_*.sql` (+rollback), `backend/src/services/territoryGeoService.js` (NEW), `backend/src/services/territoryService.js` (NEW, seam), `backend/src/db/territoryRadiusQueries.js` (NEW), `backend/src/utils/geo.js` (NEW, haversine), `backend/src/routes/service-territories.js`, `backend/src/routes/zip-check.js`, `backend/src/services/agentSkills/skills/checkServiceArea.js`, `backend/src/services/onboardingChecklistService.js`.
- Frontend: `frontend/src/pages/ServiceTerritoriesPage.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/settings/TerritoryCoverageMap.tsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/pages/WelcomePage.tsx` (иконка шага).
- Затронутые интеграции: Google Geocoding (сервер, кэш-first), Google Maps JS (фронт, read-only). Twilio/Front/Zenbooker — нет (Zenbooker-фон в useZipCheck НЕ трогаем).

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):**
- `serviceTerritoryQueries.js` (search/findByZip/bulkReplace) — используется list-режимом и seam'ом; поведение не менять.
- Существующие endpoints list-режима (GET /, /areas, /export, POST /, /bulk-import, DELETE /:zip) и их контракты.
- `getCompanyId` route-хелпер с DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID-фолбэком (прод-поведение) — сохранить.
- Write-once/visible-машина onboardingChecklistService (`getChecklist`/`markCompleted`) — меняется ТОЛЬКО состав CHECKLIST_ITEMS (замена одной записи).
- `useZipCheck.ts` + Zenbooker-фон — не трогаем; frozen-шейпы vapi/zip-check ответов.
- `src/server.js` (mount уже существует), `authedFetch.ts`, `useRealtimeEvents.ts`, slot-engine контейнер.

## TELEPHONY-WIZARD-UX-001 — переработка визарда телефонии: неявный connect + $5 welcome-бонус, опциональный шаг тарифа, комбо-поле поиска номера, port-in существующего номера, чистка Stripe-экрана (2026-07-13)

**Краткое описание:** Twilio-визард сокращается с трёх шагов до «Plans (опционален) → Number (+Transfer your number) → Done»: шаг «Set up your line» удаляется, создание Twilio-субаккаунта происходит неявно перед первым действием, которое его требует. При первом подключении телефонии компания автоматически получает $5 welcome-бонус в кошелёк и активацию payg-тарифа. Number-шаг избавляется от block-in-block, объединяет Area code + City в одно комбо-поле с подсказками локальных кодов и получает полный self-service флоу переноса (port-in) существующего номера через Twilio Porting API. Отдельно (OB-7): страница Stripe Payments теряет дублирующий блок «What it costs», чеклист «Setup steps» очеловечивается. Закрывает OB-1, OB-2, OB-3, OB-4, OB-5, OB-7.

**Решения владельца и интервью (БИНДИНГ, не менять):**
1. (OB-1.1) Шаг «Set up your line» УДАЛЯЕТСЯ. `connectTelephony` (уже идемпотентен) вызывается неявно перед первым действием, требующим субаккаунт: выбор тарифа на Plans-шаге или первый поиск/покупка номера. Никакой отдельной кнопки «Connect telephony» в визарде.
2. (OB-1.2) На Plans-шаге карта текущего тарифа НЕ дизейблится: бейдж «Current» остаётся, повторный выбор допустим и является no-op/подтверждением (без повторного списания).
3. (OB-1.3, интервью) $5 welcome-бонус начисляется АВТОМАТИЧЕСКИ при первом `connectTelephony` компании, идемпотентно (ref-дедупликация `welcome_credit:v1` через UNIQUE `idx_wallet_ledger_ref`). Вместе с бонусом, если подписка компании trial/отсутствует — активируется payg (прямая активация, `monthly_base_usd<=0`). Intro-копия Plans-шага: «You have $5 to try Albusto pay-as-you-go — or pick a package». Кнопка «Skip — get a number first» ведёт сразу на Number-шаг. Баланс бонуса показывается в визарде.
4. (OB-2) Поисковая форма Number-шага лежит в потоке шага БЕЗ серого контейнера-обёртки (канон: контейнеры невидимы, LAYOUT-CANON rule 7; урок «no block-in-block»).
5. (OB-3/OB-4) Поля Area code + City объединяются в ОДНО комбо-поле: пользователь вводит код ИЛИ город; дропдаун подсказывает «617 — Boston, MA» (код+город+штат) из СТАТИЧЕСКОГО справочника NANPA-кодов во фронте; локальные коды первыми (локация = база компании: companies.city/state/zip, фолбэк — центр territory_radii/zip_geocache); остальные коды НЕ подсказываются — ручной ввод остаётся. Тип введённого определяет Twilio-параметр (3 цифры → areaCode, текст → inLocality). Contains digits и Toll-free остаются.
6. (OB-5) Результаты поиска номеров лежат в общем потоке страницы и скроллятся экраном (канон MobileListPage: скроллит `.app-main`), без вложенных фикс-высот/внутренних скроллов; на мобиле (375px) карточки не обрезаются.
7. (OB-1.4, интервью) Port-in — ПОЛНАЯ автоматизация через Twilio Porting API (twilio-node v5: `client.numbers.v1.portingPortabilities` / `portingPortIns` — наличие в SDK 5.12.0 проверено), НЕ заявка-таска. На Number-шаге тумблер «Get a new number | Transfer your number»; проверка portability перед созданием заявки; статус-трекинг заявки в визарде и на странице телефонии. Нормативная копия с рекомендацией владельца: «We recommend grabbing a new number now — outbound calls keep flowing from it while the transfer completes, so you don't lose customers».
8. (OB-7) Stripe Payments not-connected: блок «What it costs» УДАЛЯЕТСЯ (hero остаётся единственным блоком; чипы цен внутри hero сохраняются). Чеклист «Setup steps»: пункт «Run a test payment» заменяется нормативным «Start getting paid — collect your first payment right from a job»; остальные label'ы очеловечиваются. Label рендерится фронтом с бэка — правка в `buildChecklist`.

**Пользовательские сценарии:**
1. Владелец новой компании открывает визард Telephony — Twilio: видит сразу Plans-шаг с копией про $5, карточки payg и пакетов. Жмёт «Skip — get a number first» → Number-шаг → вводит «617» в комбо-поле → первый поиск неявно создаёт Twilio-субаккаунт, начисляет $5 и активирует payg → список номеров → Buy → Done-экран.
2. Владелец на Plans-шаге выбирает payg: неявный connect (бонус+payg) происходит до/вместе с выбором; тост «Plan activated», переход на Number-шаг. Повторный заход в визард показывает payg с бейджем «Current», карта кликабельна; клик по текущему тарифу — подтверждение без списания и без ошибок.
3. Владелец выбирает платный пакет: неявный connect выполняется, затем существующий Stripe-checkout флоу (redirect, возврат на ?step с billing=success, поллинг) — без изменений.
4. Пользователь вводит в комбо-поле «Bos»: дропдаун подсказывает локальные коды базы компании («617 — Boston, MA», «857 — Boston, MA»); выбор подсказки ищет по area code. Ввод текста, не совпавшего с подсказками («Worcester»), ищет по inLocality.
5. Владелец с существующим номером у другого оператора переключает тумблер на «Transfer your number»: вводит номер → система проверяет переносимость (portability) → форма данных losing carrier (имя на счёте, account number, адрес, уполномоченный представитель + email, utility bill) → Submit → заявка создана в Twilio, статус виден в визарде и на странице телефонии; письмо на подпись LOA уходит представителю. Рядом — рекомендация взять новый номер сейчас.
6. Номер непереносим (portability check вернул portable=false) → человечное объяснение причины, заявка не создаётся, предложение взять новый номер.
7. Пользователь на iPhone (375px) проходит Number-шаг: форма без серого контейнера, результаты поиска скроллятся экраном до конца, ни одна карточка не обрезана.
8. Владелец открывает Stripe Payments (not connected): один hero-блок «Get paid on the spot» с чипами цен, без «What it costs»; в «Setup steps» последний пункт — «Start getting paid — collect your first payment right from a job».

**Ограничения и нефункциональные требования:**
- Идемпотентность бонуса обязательна: двойной/параллельный connect → ровно ОДНА запись ledger (ref `welcome_credit:v1`, UNIQUE `idx_wallet_ledger_ref`). Бонус начисляется ТОЛЬКО на пути свежего создания субаккаунта (не default-компании, не ретроактивно уже подключённым).
- Сбой начисления бонуса/активации payg НЕ валит connect (лог + продолжение); сбой connect валит действие целиком (поиск/покупка невозможны без субаккаунта).
- `connectTelephony`, `searchNumbers`, `buyNumber`, `walletService.applyDelta`, `billingService.subscribe` — реюз как есть; новая логика — обвязка вокруг них.
- Stripe-checkout флоу платных тарифов (redirect/поллинг/return_path-валидация) — байт-в-байт прежний.
- Порт-ин: НИКАКОЙ покупки/операций без company-scope; заявки строго изолированы по company_id (чужой id → 404). Porting API вызывается master-клиентом с accountSid целевого субаккаунта компании (Porting API работает на уровне top-level аккаунта; решение документируется в спеке).
- Если на реальном Twilio-аккаунте Porting API окажется недоступен (feature-gate у Twilio), UI показывает честный fallback-стейт «transfer через поддержку», заявка сохраняется локально со статусом action_required — вопрос эскалируется оркестратору (кэп сложности из интервью).
- Справочник area-кодов — статический TS-модуль (~350 US-кодов, код→{city,state,lat,lon}), без внешних запросов; сортировка по близости к базе компании через лёгкий backend-endpoint locale (companies → zip_geocache → territory_radii), без вызова внешних geocoding API на горячем пути.
- Дизайн-канон: без block-in-block, FloatingField, токены `--blanc-*`, мобайл 375px; слово «Blanc» в UI запрещено.
- Тесты: 401/403 + tenant isolation для всех новых endpoints; jest на идемпотентность $5 (двойной connect → один кредит); vitest на сортировку/тип-детекцию комбо-поля.

**Потенциально вовлечённые модули/части системы:**
- Backend: `backend/src/services/telephonyTenantService.js` (welcome-бонус в connectTelephony, ensure-обвязка), `backend/src/routes/telephonyNumbers.js` (ленивый connect в /search и /buy, endpoint locale), `backend/src/services/portInService.js` (NEW), `backend/src/routes/telephonyPortIn.js` (NEW), `backend/db/migrations/169_port_in_requests.sql` (+rollback, NEW), `backend/src/services/stripePaymentsService.js` (buildChecklist labels), `src/server.js` (ОДНА строка mount /api/telephony/port-in).
- Frontend: `frontend/src/pages/TelephonyTwilioSettingsPage.tsx` (перестройка шагов), `frontend/src/data/areaCodes.ts` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/telephony/AreaCodeCombo.tsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/telephony/PortInPanel.tsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/pages/telephony/PhoneNumbersPage.tsx` (секция port-in статусов), `frontend/src/pages/StripePaymentsSettingsPage.tsx` (OB-7).
- Затронутые интеграции: Twilio (Porting API — новая поверхность; subaccounts/numbers — реюз), Stripe (только UI/копия; API-флоу не меняется). Front/Zenbooker — нет.

**Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать):**
- `telephonyTenantService.getClientForCompany/searchNumbers/buyNumber/ensureSoftphoneSetup` — сигнатуры и контракты (409 TELEPHONY_NOT_CONNECTED для НЕ-визардных потребителей остаётся: ленивый connect добавляется точечно в маршруты визарда, а не глобально в getClientForCompany).
- `walletService.applyDelta` (транзакция/FOR UPDATE/ref-дедуп) и `billingService.subscribe` (вкл. Stripe-путь платных тарифов, анти-open-redirect валидация return_path в routes/billing.js).
- Derived-step принцип визарда (сервер — источник правды, ?step= только hint), NUMBER_LIMIT-upsell (422 + verbatim server text), поллинг billing=success.
- Webhook-контракты Twilio (AccountSid→company, per-subaccount подпись), callFlowRuntime, autonomous-mode.
- `computeReadiness`/`canCollect`/весь Stripe connect-механизм (OB-7 меняет ТОЛЬКО labels чеклиста и вёрстку not-connected экрана).
- `src/server.js` — только добавление одной mount-строки по канону (authenticate, requirePermission('tenant.telephony.manage'), requireCompanyAccess); ядро не трогать. `authedFetch.ts`, `useRealtimeEvents.ts` — не трогать.
- Миграции ≤168; `CloudBanner`/`.blanc-cloud` — реюз как есть.

**Iteration T6 — решения владельца (БИНДИНГ, 2026-07-13; поверх T1–T5):**
1. Визард = **3 шага**: 1 Pick your plan ($5) → 2 Choose your number → 3 Transfer your numbers. Сегмент «Get a new number | Transfer your number» со шага 2 убирается — transfer становится шагом 3. Шаг 2 получает тёплое пояснение над поиском (номер может быть временным на период переноса или остаться основным). Шаг 3 = «now or later»: «Transfer now» (T4-панель переезжает сюда) / «I'll do it later» → визард завершён; выбор Later персистится на сервере, визард не возвращает на шаг 3.
2. Постоянный раздел телефонии (`PhoneNumbersPage`): «Get another number» (реюз визардной формы поиска), «Transfer a number» (реюз PortInPanel в panel-слое), список номеров и трансферов — канон-раскладка в спеке §T6.2.
3. Баннер «Finish transferring your number» наверху раздела: показывается когда номер куплен, но нет ни одного port-in запроса и не нажато «Don't show again». Dismiss = серверный флаг `companies.settings.port_in_prompt='dismissed'` (паттерн onboarding_checklist, COALESCE-`||`, НЕ jsonb_set — L-003); «Later» на шаге 3 и «Don't show again» в баннере пишут ОДИН флаг. Endpoint — в существующем telephony-route (`tenant.telephony.manage`): POST dismiss + `port_in_prompt` в ответе `GET /numbers/status`.
4. Нормативные строки (подписи шагов, пояснение шага 2, копия шага 3 и баннера) — зафиксированы в спеке §T6, тёплым тоном, без «Blanc» в UI.

## YELP-CONVO-CONTEXT-002 — Yelp booking agent gets the FULL conversation in its prompt (bounded transcript) + agent replies become visible on the Pulse timeline (2026-07-13)

**Status:** Requirements · **Priority:** P1 · **Backend-only** · **Date:** 2026-07-13
**Foundation:** YELP-CONVO-BOOKING-001 (`runTurn` brain, LIVE prod) + YELP-TIMELINE-DEDUP-001 (conv-id
timelines, LIVE prod) + YELP-REPLY-THREADING-001/002 (threaded sends, LIVE prod). Owner asks (verbatim):
«А контекст не теряет агент? Он учитывает всю переписку с лидом?» and «Сейчас отправленные ответы не
выводятся в таймлайне, что сбивает с толку — в реальности агент ответил.» One feature, two halves +
observability.

### Context (what is broken — verified in code 2026-07-13)
1. **The agent is amnesiac.** `yelpConvoAgentService.buildPrompt` (backend/src/services/yelpConvoAgentService.js:192-210)
   composes every turn from ONLY: SYSTEM_PROMPT + phase/turn_count + `collected` JSON + offered slots +
   the CURRENT inbound body (raw `msg.body_text` from yelpLeadService.js:419/:587, sliced to
   `MAX_INBOUND_CHARS`=2000 at :73/:193) + this-turn tool results. It never sees the customer's earlier
   messages nor its own earlier replies. The transcript already exists in `email_messages`: inbound rows
   are linked to the conv-id timeline (contact_id NULL + timeline_id + on_timeline=true —
   emailTimelineService.js:149-153), and outbound agent sends are hydrated into `email_messages` in the
   same Gmail thread by `emailService.sendEmail` itself (emailService.js:129-142) — just never linked.
2. **Agent replies are invisible in Pulse.** Neither agent send site links the sent message:
   `yelpConvoAgentService.sendOnce` (:232-248) and the one-shot `yelp_lead` greeter
   (agentHandlers.js:237-243) call `emailService.sendEmail` and stop. The generic outbound linker
   `emailTimelineService.linkOutboundMessage` (:418) structurally cannot rescue them — it matches by
   RECIPIENT contact, and a Yelp send goes to the contactless varying `reply+<hex>@` relay →
   `{skipped:'no_contact'}` (:444-446). With `timeline_id` NULL the row is invisible to both the
   timeline detail (`getTimelineEmailByTimeline`, emailQueries.js:654-672, keys
   `timeline_id + on_timeline=true`) and the Pulse list `email_by_timeline` CTE
   (timelinesQueries.js:516-546). The dispatcher sees a one-sided conversation.

### Binding decisions (clarified with the owner — do not re-litigate)
- History is sourced from `email_messages` — NO new tables, NO new columns, NO migrations.
- Historical sends that Yelp BOUNCED are still included in the history (the agent did say them).
- The history char-cap SIZE is an Architect decision (this doc fixes the shape, not the number).
- Backfill = separate owner-run script (backend/scripts/ is NOT in the Docker image → scp +
  `docker cp` into the container to run), modeled on backend/scripts/yelp_timeline_dedup_cleanup.js.
- Backend-only. FE verified to need nothing: both read paths project linked outbound rows identically
  to contact-timeline emails, incl. `(direction='outbound') AS is_outbound` (emailQueries.js:665), and
  the FE already renders right-aligned outbound email bubbles + the by-contact DTO passes Yelp fields
  through (YELP-TL-DEDUP-002).
- Company-scoped everything; fail-open (history assembly failure → degrade that turn to today's
  no-history prompt; the turn still sends).

### Use cases
1. **Customer references the past.** Turn 3, the customer writes "the time you offered works" or
   repeats/corrects an address from turn 1 — the agent's prompt contains the prior exchange, so it
   answers consistently with what it and the customer already said (no re-asking answered questions,
   no contradicting its own earlier reply).
2. **Dispatcher audits the conversation.** Opens the Yelp lead's Pulse timeline → sees BOTH the
   customer's messages and every agent reply (greeting, replies, booking confirm, call-fallback)
   right-aligned, in order; an open timeline shows a new agent send live via SSE.
3. **Turn-0 greeting is visible.** A new Yelp lead arrives, the agent greets — the greeting appears on
   that conversation's timeline immediately after the send, without marking the timeline unread.
4. **Owner backfills history.** Owner runs the backfill (dry-run → mapping review → --apply --yes) —
   historical agent sends (Jenna tl 3208, Kim tl 3207/3210, Ai tl 3213, Corey/Steve/Ryan) appear on
   their conv-id timelines, bounced ones included; a second run no-ops.
5. **History fetch breaks, nothing else does.** email_messages read fails mid-turn → the agent runs
   today's no-history prompt, still sends exactly one reply; the log records the degradation.

### Functional requirements

- **R1 — `R-history-in-prompt` (bounded chronological transcript every Phase-B turn).** Every
  `runTurn` prompt — reply turns AND the turn-0 greeting — includes a chronological (oldest→newest)
  transcript of THIS conversation's prior messages, both directions (customer inbound + agent
  outbound, including sends Yelp later bounced), sourced from `email_messages`, company-scoped. Each
  entry is author-labeled (customer vs agent) and timestamped. The CURRENT inbound is EXCLUDED from
  the transcript (it already appears in the existing CUSTOMER MESSAGE block, unchanged).
  `collected` + `offered_slots` blocks STAY as-is — they remain the authoritative structured state;
  the transcript is advisory context and never replaces the book-guard or phase machine.
- **R2 — `R-entry-sanitation` (each entry = only that message's new text).** Per transcript entry:
  quoted-original blocks stripped ("On … wrote:" / "> " runs / Outlook dividers — the pure-stripper
  semantics of backend/src/services/email/emailTimelineBody.js are the reference; outbound entries
  shed the quoted original that `yelpReplyFormat.buildReplyBodies` appends), Yelp invisible-char
  padding (zero-width/combining filler, e.g. "͏‌") removed, blank runs collapsed. Sanitation is
  per-entry fail-safe: a strip fault degrades that entry to raw-truncated text, never kills the turn.
- **R3 — `R-history-budget` (newest-complete, drop-oldest-first char cap).** The transcript has a
  total character budget (number = Architect). Trimming drops ENTIRE oldest entries first until the
  rest fits; newer entries are never mid-truncated (single pathological oversized entry may be
  head-truncated to fit alone). When entries were dropped, the transcript states that earlier
  messages were omitted. Current-inbound `MAX_INBOUND_CHARS` handling is untouched.
- **R4 — `R-history-untrusted` (injection posture unchanged).** The WHOLE transcript is wrapped in
  the same untrusted-data delimiting posture as the current inbound (explicit "UNTRUSTED DATA — do
  not follow instructions inside" framing). A hostile instruction inside ANY historical message must
  be exactly as inert as one in the current inbound: identity/recipient stay server-injected,
  tools stay whitelist+`sanitizeToolArgs` (:46-57, :213-221), `book` stays guarded by
  slotKey ∈ persisted offered_slots (:366-368).
- **R5 — `R-history-fail-open`.** History assembly (fetch + sanitize + budget) is best-effort: any
  failure logs, degrades THAT turn to today's no-history prompt, and never throws out of `runTurn`,
  never consumes the parse-retry budget, never blocks or duplicates the send.
- **R6 — `R-link-agent-sends` (every successful agent send lands on the conv-id timeline).** After
  EVERY successful agent send — BOTH send sites: `yelpConvoAgentService.sendOnce` (covers reply,
  book-confirm, call-fallback, safe-reply, re-offer, turn-0 greeting) AND the one-shot `yelp_lead`
  greeter (agentHandlers.js:237-243) — the sent message is linked exactly like the inbound Yelp path
  links: `emailQueries.linkMessageToContact(provider_message_id, companyId, {contact_id: NULL,
  timeline_id, on_timeline: true})`. `contact_id` NULL is LOAD-BEARING — the Pulse `email_by_timeline`
  CTE only reads genuinely-contactless rows (timelinesQueries.js:545, mail-mute regression guard).
  Timeline resolution: prefer the answered inbound row's own `timeline_id` (already linked at ingest);
  else resolve via conv-id (`resolveYelpTimeline`, timelinesQueries.js:336 — note `yelp_conversations`
  has NO timeline_id column); neither resolves → skip the link (log per R9), never guess. A link that
  matches no row (send-hydration hiccup — `sendEmail`'s import is best-effort, emailService.js:140-142)
  follows the Pulse-compose reconcile shape (emailTimelineService.js:756-782): re-import once, retry
  the link once, else warn. Linking is strictly POST-send and best-effort: a link failure NEVER fails
  the turn, never enters the `__sendFault` throw surface, never causes a task retry/double-send.
- **R7 — `R-link-realtime-no-unread`.** A newly-linked agent send publishes the realtime
  message-added event like the existing email paths (`realtimeService.publishMessageAdded(item,
  {id: null}, timelineId)` — emailTimelineService.js:159/:821) so an open timeline shows the bubble
  live. It must NOT mark the timeline unread, NOT set Action-Required, NOT create a contact (the
  linkOutboundMessage doctrine, emailTimelineService.js:407-409). Idempotent: an already-linked
  message re-processed does not re-publish.
- **R8 — `R-backfill-historical-sends` (one-off, owner-run, idempotent).** A script links EXISTING
  historical agent sends onto their conv-id timelines — bounced sends included. Known affected
  conversations: Jenna tl 3208, Kim tl 3207/3210, Ai tl 3213, Corey/Steve/Ryan — but discovery must
  be data-driven (attribute outbound rows to conversations, e.g. via their Gmail thread's already-
  linked inbound rows), not this hardcoded list. Modeled on yelp_timeline_dedup_cleanup.js: default
  company by default + `--company`, dry-run prints the full plan (message ↔ timeline mapping),
  `--apply --yes` to write, idempotent (2nd run no-ops), every statement company-scoped, NEVER
  auto-run (not a migration, not wired into ingest/poll). UPDATE-only linking (non-destructive; no
  deletes, no unread flips). Run procedure documented in the script header (scp + `docker cp` — the
  scripts dir is not in the image).
- **R9 — `R-observability`.** (a) One log line per turn with assembled history size — message count,
  char count, dropped-entry count — or the explicit no-history degradation; (b) one log line per
  agent send with the link outcome (linked / relinked-after-reimport / no-row / resolve-miss / error)
  + timeline id. Log-only; no new metrics infrastructure.

### Non-functional requirements
- **N1 — No schema.** No migrations, tables, or columns. Optional tuning knobs follow the existing
  `YELP_CONVO_*` env pattern (yelpConvoAgentService.js:60-68); none may be REQUIRED for correctness.
- **N2 — Perf.** History adds at most one bounded, indexed, company-scoped read per turn (turns are
  minutes apart). The hot Pulse list query gains ZERO new per-row work — linking writes only the
  existing indexed columns (idx_email_messages_timeline, mig 165).
- **N3 — LLM budget.** No new LLM calls; transport, models, temperature, maxOutputTokens untouched;
  only the prompt text grows (within R3's cap).
- **N4 — Flags-off behavior.** `YELP_CONVO_ENABLED=false` Phase-A ack path (agentHandlers.js:314-326)
  is byte-identical; `YELP_AUTORESPONDER_ENABLED` gating unchanged. Backend jest green +
  `npm run build` (tsc -b) green.

### Out of scope
- Any frontend change (verified unnecessary — see binding decisions).
- Unread / Action-Required semantics for agent sends (stay OFF), contact creation (stays
  lead-path-only per YELP-TIMELINE-DEDUP-001 R3/R4), mail-mute changes.
- Re-sending or retro-repairing bounced messages (they only become visible/known context).
- LLM summarization/compression of history; any persisted transcript store or conversation memory
  beyond `email_messages`.
- Mail Secretary, non-Yelp email agents, the voice agent.
- Prod deploy (deploy-consent rule: only on the owner's explicit «да»).

### Protected invariants (verified present — behavior must survive)
- Exactly ONE send per turn; every terminal path performs a single `sendOnce`
  (yelpConvoAgentService.js:12, all terminals).
- `__sendFault`-only throw surface out of `runTurn` (:244-247, :606-620); history/link failures are
  absorbed — they must never re-queue a task or double-send.
- Bounded loop: `MAX_TOOLCALLS`/`MAX_TURNS`/deadline (:64-66, :435, :455-458, :468-471),
  identical-(tool,args) loop-detector (:514-521), bounded parse-retry (:486-495).
- Book-guard + server-injected identity: slotKey ∈ persisted offered_slots (:366-368),
  `STRIPPED_ARG_KEYS`/whitelist (:46-57, :505-507); hold write shape via `updateLead` only (:351-408).
- YELP-REPLY-FORMAT-001: the SENT message keeps the quoted-original multipart format
  (`yelpReplyFormat.buildReplyBodies`, :235) — R2's stripping applies to the PROMPT only, never to
  what is sent.
- YELP-REPLY-THREADING-001/002: `resolveThreading` incl. the `:greet0` claim-suffix strip
  (`String(rawPmid).split(':')[0]`, :261-289) — every send stays threaded.
- At-most-once claims + post-send markers: per-inbound `claimYelpLead` gate and best-effort
  `markGreeted`/`markReplied` (agentHandlers.js:297-310, :342-354); greeting dedup namespace intact.
- `email_by_timeline` CTE `contact_id IS NULL` scoping (timelinesQueries.js:545) and
  `linkMessageToContact` idempotent-UPDATE semantics keyed `(company_id, provider_message_id)`
  (emailQueries.js:466-478).
- Existing `runSkill` invocation shape incl. its `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` argument
  (yelpConvoAgentService.js:526) — pre-existing, NOT to be "fixed" in this feature.
- Protected files per project-context (src/server.js, authedFetch.ts, useRealtimeEvents.ts,
  backend/db/ untouched — R8 is a script, not a migration).

### Open items for the Architect
- **A1 — cap + source key.** The history char-cap number (and optional entry-count cap), and the
  exact transcript source key: timeline-linked rows only (R6 links new sends; R8 backfills old ones)
  vs a union with the conversation's Gmail-thread outbound rows — must include bounced sends and be
  correct for conversations that predate the backfill run.
- **A2 — entry format + sanitizer placement.** Label/timestamp rendering; reuse
  `emailTimelineBody.js` pure stripper vs a Yelp-local strip; the precise invisible-char set.
- **A3 — backfill attribution + output.** The discovery predicate attributing an outbound row to a
  conversation, and the dry-run mapping format the owner confirms before `--apply`.

### Modules involved / integrations
- Modules: `backend/src/services/yelpConvoAgentService.js` (prompt assembly + post-send link),
  `backend/src/services/agentHandlers.js` (`yelp_lead` greeter link), `backend/src/db/emailQueries.js`
  (bounded history read; linkMessageToContact reuse), `backend/src/db/timelinesQueries.js`
  (`resolveYelpTimeline` reuse), `backend/src/services/email/emailTimelineBody.js` (strip reuse),
  `backend/src/services/realtimeService.js` (publish reuse), `backend/scripts/` (new backfill script).
- Integrations: Gmail (reads/links already-hydrated rows; send behavior byte-unchanged), Gemini
  (prompt grows within existing transport), Yelp relay (send format untouched). Twilio / Front /
  Zenbooker / Stripe — none.

## MARKETPLACE-LEADGEN-SPLIT-001 — split the marketplace «Lead Generator» app into five per-source lead apps (Website / Pro Referral / Rely / NSA / LHG), catalog-only (2026-07-13)

> Status: requirements (Product 01). **Catalog-only change:** NO lead-creation behavior change, NO external-service change (the Vultr rely-lead-processor keeps posting exactly as today), expected NO frontend change (verified below). Binding owner decisions from the interview are baked in and marked **[OWNER]**.

**Краткое описание.** Today ONE marketplace app (`app_key='lead-generator'`, name "Lead Generator") represents ALL externally-posted lead sources. Prod `job_source` over 90 days: Pro Referral=163, Rely=57, Web site order=52, NSA=42, LHG=1 — five distinct streams behind one tile. Split the catalog so each source is its own app: rename the existing app to **"Website Leads"** (key unchanged) and add four new per-source apps, auto-connected for the default company against the SAME live credential. Purely a `marketplace_apps` / `marketplace_installations` catalog re-shape.

### Verified code/schema facts (downstream agents: do NOT re-derive, do NOT contradict)

- `marketplace_apps.app_key` is `TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE`; migration 083 seeds `lead-generator` (name "Lead Generator", provider "Blanc Labs", category `lead_generation`, `app_type='internal'`, scopes `["leads:create"]`, `provisioning_mode='manual'`, published) with `ON CONFLICT (app_key) DO UPDATE` (`backend/db/migrations/083_create_marketplace_apps.sql:118-180`).
- `marketplace_installations` has **NO plain UNIQUE(company_id, app_id)** — it is a **partial unique index** `idx_marketplace_installations_one_active ON (company_id, app_id) WHERE status IN ('connected','provisioning_failed')` (083:63-65). Disconnected/revoked rows can accumulate; only one ACTIVE row per (company, app). `api_integration_id` is nullable, FK `ON DELETE SET NULL`, **non-unique index** — several installations MAY legally share one credential.
- `ensureMarketplaceSchema` (`backend/src/db/marketplaceQueries.js:12-48`) **re-runs the whole seed list at every boot** (advisory-lock txn). Because 083's `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` re-asserts the name "Lead Generator" on every boot, any rename NOT registered in that list AFTER 083 is silently reverted at next restart (precedent: the 132-after-087 ordering comment at marketplaceQueries.js:38-41).
- `disconnectInstallation` (`backend/src/services/marketplaceService.js:502-543`) calls `revokeCredentialById(installation.api_integration_id)` which sets `api_integrations.revoked_at`; `integrationsAuth.js:141` then rejects the token. **With a shared credential, one Disconnect click is a kill-switch for ALL five sources.** The generic tile UI offers that Disconnect button (IntegrationsPage.tsx:306-309).
- `installApp` (marketplaceService.js) mints a NEW credential when `provisioning_mode !== 'none'` — self-service Enable by other companies behaves for the new apps exactly as for today's Lead Generator.
- External ingestion contract: `POST /leads` in `backend/src/routes/integrations-leads.js:33` = `authenticateIntegration` (api_integrations by key_id, `revoked_at` check) + `requireIntegrationScope('leads:create')`. **Token+scope only — no marketplace-app or per-source coupling anywhere.** Grep of `backend/src`, `frontend/src`, `src` for `lead-generator` gates: **zero hits**.
- Frontend genericity: `IntegrationsPage.tsx` hardcodes app_keys only for `vapi-ai` / `stripe-payments` / `google-email` / `telephony-twilio` (setup-page buttons) and value-copy for `smart-slot-engine` / `ai-repair-advisor`; every other app renders through the generic branch (Enable → `MarketplaceConnectDialog`, connected → Disconnect / optional `metadata.setup_path` Setup). `provider_name` is not rendered anywhere in the marketplace UI today. → New lead apps need **zero frontend work**.
- Prod state: exactly ONE installation of `lead-generator` (default company `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`, status connected, `api_integration_id=1` = the LIVE token the external service posts with). Latest migration in repo: 168 → this feature takes **169**.

### Пользовательские сценарии (use cases)

- **US-1 (catalog shows 5 lead apps).** The owner opens `/settings/integrations` and sees five lead-source apps: **Website Leads, Pro Referral Leads, Rely Leads, NSA Leads, LHG Leads** — English names, one tile per source, rendered by the existing generic tile UI.
- **US-2 (per-source connect state).** For the default company all five show **Connected**, each backed by its own `marketplace_installations` row, so the owner sees at a glance which lead sources the company runs.
- **US-3 (external service unaffected).** Before, during, and after the migration the Vultr rely-lead-processor keeps POSTing leads for ALL sources with the SAME token; every post succeeds identically to today. Zero ingestion downtime, zero config change on the external side.
- **US-4 (other companies).** Any other company sees the five apps in the catalog as **available-but-disconnected** (no auto-connect for them); clicking Enable follows the existing generic install path (mints its own `leads:create` credential), exactly like today's Lead Generator.
- **US-5 (disconnect of ONE source app is not a kill-switch).** If the owner disconnects e.g. "NSA Leads", the other four apps stay Connected and ingestion for ALL sources keeps working — the shared live credential must survive (see FR-5/NFR-1).
- **US-6 (rollback).** Running the rollback restores the single-app catalog (name "Lead Generator", 4 new app rows and their seeded installations gone) **without touching** the live `lead-generator` installation row or `api_integrations` row 1 — ingestion never blinks.

### Функциональные требования

- **FR-1 (new catalog rows) [OWNER].** Migration **169** inserts four `marketplace_apps` rows mirroring the `lead-generator` shape (category `lead_generation`, `app_type='internal'`, `requested_scopes=["leads:create"]`, `provisioning_mode='manual'`, `status='published'`), seeded idempotently by `app_key` (`ON CONFLICT (app_key) DO UPDATE`, same as 083): keys **`pro-referral-leads`, `rely-leads`, `nsa-leads`, `lhg-leads`**; names **"Pro Referral Leads", "Rely Leads", "NSA Leads", "LHG Leads"**; `provider_name='Albusto'`. `short_description` / `long_description` / `metadata.access_summary` = **draft texts** (one factual sentence per source + `["Create leads"]`), to be refined later when each service is доработан — drafts must NOT promise per-source enforcement (see FR-6).
- **FR-2 (rename, key frozen) [OWNER].** The existing `lead-generator` row is renamed to **"Website Leads"**; **`app_key` stays `lead-generator`** (live installation/token untouched). Its other fields (incl. `provider_name='Blanc Labs'`) are NOT rebranded here (out of scope, follow-up).
- **FR-3 (rename survives every boot).** The 169 seed is registered in `ensureMarketplaceSchema` **after** `083_create_marketplace_apps.sql`, so the rename + new rows self-heal on every restart instead of being reverted by 083's `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` re-seed (132-after-087 precedent).
- **FR-4 (auto-connect seeding, company-scoped) [OWNER].** Migration 169 seeds four `marketplace_installations` rows **only** for the default company `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`: `status='connected'`, `api_integration_id=1` (the SAME live credential), `installed_at` set, sensible `metadata` note (seeded-by-MARKETPLACE-LEADGEN-SPLIT-001). No row is created for any other company. **Idempotency guard must check existence across ALL statuses** (NOT-EXISTS per (company, app)), because the partial unique index does not cover disconnected/revoked rows — a boot-time re-run must neither duplicate rows nor RESURRECT an installation the owner intentionally disconnected.
- **FR-5 (disconnect isolation — the one permitted non-catalog guard).** Disconnecting any one of the five lead apps must NOT revoke `api_integrations` row 1 while another connected installation still references the same `api_integration_id`. Today `disconnectInstallation` unconditionally revokes — the Architect chooses the mechanism (shared-credential refcount guard in the disconnect path, or an equivalent seeding choice that keeps the credential safe) — but the requirement is absolute: **one Disconnect never breaks the other four sources.** Lead-creation code paths themselves stay untouched.
- **FR-6 (honest connect-state semantics).** Per-source connect state is **catalog/informational**: enforcement remains token+scope (`leads:create`) at `POST /leads`, with NO per-app gate — disconnecting "Rely Leads" does not stop Rely lead ingestion in this feature. No UI string, description, or doc introduced here may claim otherwise. (Per-source enforcement = explicit follow-up, out of scope.)
- **FR-7 (rollback, live-token-safe).** `rollback_169_*.sql` restores the pre-split catalog: deletes the seeded installations of the four new apps, then the four app rows (FK `ON DELETE RESTRICT` order: installations first; if other companies self-installed a new app, those installation rows are deleted too — their minted credentials are left to `ON DELETE SET NULL`, documented in the script header), and renames "Website Leads" back to "Lead Generator". It must NOT touch the original `lead-generator` installation row, `api_integrations` row 1, or any other app's rows. (Rolling back also requires removing the 169 entry from `ensureMarketplaceSchema`, noted in the script header.)

### Нефункциональные требования

- **NFR-1 (live-token safety — THE critical NFR).** `api_integrations` row 1 (`revoked_at`, `scopes`, `key_id`, `secret_hash`, `company_id`) must never be modified, revoked, or expired by the migration, the boot-time re-runs, seeding, disconnect of any new app (FR-5), or rollback (FR-7). Acceptance = zero failed external posts attributable to this feature across all five `job_source` streams.
- **NFR-2 (idempotent migration).** Migration 169 is re-runnable arbitrarily many times (it will be — `ensureMarketplaceSchema` executes it at every boot inside the advisory-lock transaction): apps via `ON CONFLICT (app_key) DO UPDATE`, installations via the all-statuses NOT-EXISTS guard of FR-4.
- **NFR-3 (company-scoped seeding).** Installation seeding touches exactly one company (default); multi-tenant isolation intact — no other company's catalog state changes except seeing four more published (disconnected) apps.
- **NFR-4 (English UI, no "Blanc" in NEW strings).** All user-visible strings of the NEW rows (names, descriptions, `access_summary`) are English and contain no "Blanc"; new rows use Albusto-branded values (`provider_name='Albusto'`; support/privacy/docs fields Albusto-flavored, not `blanc.local`). Existing rows' "Blanc Labs" stays as-is (follow-up).
- **NFR-5 (no frontend change).** The five apps render through the existing generic tile branch + `MarketplaceConnectDialog`; no `frontend/src` file is edited. If a screen turns out to need an app-key special case, that is a spec violation to escalate, not to hardcode.
- **NFR-6 (no external-service change).** Nothing under the external contract changes: `POST /leads` route, `integrationsAuth` / `integrationScopes` middleware, payload/`job_source` handling stay byte-identical; the Vultr rely-lead-processor is not redeployed or reconfigured.

### Out of scope (explicit)

- Per-source ENFORCEMENT (making a disconnected per-source app actually block/route that source's leads) — future feature per FR-6.
- Re-branding existing `provider_name='Blanc Labs'` rows (call-qa-agent, lead-generator, etc.) to "Albusto" — noted follow-up.
- Final marketing copy for the four new apps — descriptions ship as drafts, refined when each source's service is доработан.
- Splitting the shared token into per-app credentials, or any `api_integrations` re-issuance.
- Any change to the external poster (Vultr rely-lead-processor), its payloads, or `job_source` values/renames; any lead-pipeline change at all.
- Yelp lead flows (task-based agent pipeline, not marketplace-token based) and the onboarding checklist.

### Потенциально вовлечённые модули (по architecture.md)

- `backend/db/migrations/170_split_lead_generator_marketplace_apps.sql` (+ `rollback_169_*.sql`) — NEW.
- `backend/src/db/marketplaceQueries.js` — register 169 in `ensureMarketplaceSchema` after 083 (FR-3).
- `backend/src/services/marketplaceService.js` — ONLY if the Architect places the FR-5 shared-credential disconnect guard there; no other service change.
- `Docs/*` — this entry + downstream chain. **No `frontend/src` modules** (NFR-5).

### Затронутые интеграции

- Twilio / Front / Zenbooker / Google Places / Gmail / Stripe / VAPI — **none**.
- External lead-poster (Vultr rely-lead-processor) — explicitly UNTOUCHED (NFR-6); its token keeps working (NFR-1).

### Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать)

- `backend/src/routes/integrations-leads.js` (`POST /leads` contract) + `backend/src/middleware/integrationsAuth.js` / `integrationScopes.js` — do not edit.
- `api_integrations` row 1 (live credential) — no UPDATE of any kind (NFR-1).
- The existing `lead-generator` `marketplace_installations` row (id, `api_integration_id` link, status) — untouched by migration and rollback.
- Seeds/lifecycle of the other marketplace apps (call-qa-agent, mail-secretary, vapi-ai, stripe-payments, smart-slot-engine, google-email, telephony-twilio, ai-repair-advisor) and the `ensureMarketplaceSchema` ordering of existing entries.
- `frontend/src/pages/IntegrationsPage.tsx` generic branch + `MarketplaceConnectDialog` — no edits (NFR-5).
- Protected-files list from project-context.md (`src/server.js`, `authedFetch.ts`, `useRealtimeEvents.ts`; `backend/db/` changes only via this feature's explicit migration plan).

## OUTBOUND-LEAD-CALL-001 — outbound voice agent (Sara) auto-calls every NEW LEAD from configured lead sources and books the customer into the schedule (marketplace app; launch source: Pro Referral) (2026-07-13)

**Status:** Requirements (Product / Agent-01) · **Priority:** P1 · **Owner:** Voice / CRM / Leads
**Type:** feature — **backend** (a `lead.created` trigger hook that starts an outbound call chain on the EXISTING outbound dialer infrastructure; business-hours gating in the company timezone; a 3-attempt retry ladder with scenario-scoped config; goal-achieved retry skip; dispatcher task on exhaustion; a new scenario discriminator inside the SAME outbound VAPI assistant) + **marketplace app** (catalog row + per-company connect/disconnect + settings page with a lead-source multi-select) + **frontend** (the settings page only — Pulse timeline visibility of attempts already exists).

**Binding owner decisions (Step 0.5 — these OVERRIDE any conflicting assumption):**
- **D1 — Retry ladder.** 3 attempts on failure to reach: **immediately / +30 min / +2 h**. After the 3rd failed attempt → create a **dispatcher task** ("couldn't reach the lead"). Retry/backoff config uses the **same mechanism as the parts robot** (`outbound_call_settings`-style per-company resolve with safe-fail defaults) — but **scenario-scoped**: this feature's ladder must be configurable independently of the parts-robot ladder (`['immediate','+2h','next_business_morning']` stays untouched for parts).
- **D2 — Calling window.** Company **business hours in the company timezone** only (dispatch settings `work_days` + `work_start_time`/`work_end_time` + company timezone — the same source the schedule/slot engine uses). A lead created out of hours **waits for the next business-day start**.
- **D3 — Call IMMEDIATELY on lead creation.** No grace delay, no human-takeover cancellation (owner explicitly chose speed over the OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-CANCEL-001-style guards — a dispatcher softphone call to the lead does NOT cancel the chain). **EXCEPTION (goal-achieved, not takeover):** a RETRY attempt is skipped when the lead is already booked — schedule-hold set (`LeadDateTime`) or the lead is closed (`Lost`/`Converted`) — re-dialing a booked lead never happens.
- **D4 — Persona.** **Sara** — the same voice/persona as inbound and parts calls; implemented as a **new scenario discriminator inside the SAME outbound VAPI assistant** the parts robot uses (`VAPI_OUTBOUND_ASSISTANT_ID`). NO new assistant is created.
- **D5 — Launch source.** **Pro Referral** is the first configured source; the settings must support any source from the canonical list.

### Duplication check (result)

**Not a duplicate — a new auto-trigger + lead-scoped chain on top of proven infra.** Adjacent features, reused and distinguished:

- **OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-001/-TECHSLOT/-CANCEL (`## OUTBOUND-PARTS-CALL-001`)** built the outbound dialer infrastructure this feature RUNS ON: `outbound_call_attempts` retry queue (per-chain partial-unique concurrency guard), `outboundCallWorker.js` (60s tick, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` claim, safe-fail), `outboundCallSettingsService.js`, `outboundCallService.placeCall` (VAPI `POST /call`, `assistantOverrides.variableValues`, registered-number-or-transient-Twilio caller-ID), end-of-call webhook retry classification, and `vapiCallTimelineService` Pulse mirroring. That feature is **job-scoped and human-triggered** (task button); this one is **lead-scoped and auto-triggered** (`lead.created`). Its CANCEL-001 guards are deliberately NOT reused (D3).
- **VAPI-SLOT-ENGINE-001 / AGENT-SKILLS-001/-002** — Sara's booking toolset is reused verbatim: `validateAddress`/`checkServiceArea`/`recommendSlots` (slot-engine incl. TECH-DAYOFF-001 seam and nearest-fallback) and the schedule-hold write (`LeadDateTime`/`LeadEndDateTime` semantics of `bookOnLead`/`createLead` hold).
- **YELP-CONVO-BOOKING-001** books leads over **email** with the same skills; this feature is the **voice** twin for phone-first sources. Its injection-hardening precedent (book only `slotKey ∈ offered_slots`; identity server-injected) carries over.
- **MARKETPLACE-LEADGEN-SPLIT-001** created per-source lead-INGESTION catalog apps (`pro-referral-leads` etc., catalog-informational). This feature is a separate CONSUMER app; its source multi-select is its own setting and is NOT coupled to those apps' connect state.
- **MAIL-AGENT-002 activation-date gate** — precedent for "enabling never backfills history" (FR-14).

### 1. Description

When a new lead arrives from a paid lead source (launch: Pro Referral), speed-to-call decides whether we win the job. Today a dispatcher must notice the lead and dial by hand. This feature ships a marketplace app: once connected, every NEW lead whose source is in the company's configured list and which has a dialable phone number gets an **automatic outbound call from Sara within the business-hours window** — immediately when in hours, at the next business-day start otherwise. Sara opens with the lead's context (name, zip, problem description), qualifies, offers slot-engine-ranked appointment windows, and books the pick as a **schedule-blocking hold on that same lead** (identical semantics to Sara inbound / VAPI-SLOT-ENGINE-001). Unreached leads are retried per the D1 ladder; after the final failure a dispatcher task takes over. Every attempt is visible live in the Pulse timeline with recording/transcript/summary on finalize.

### 2. User Scenarios

- **SC-01 (happy path).** A Pro Referral lead (name, zip, problem, phone) is created at 10:02 on a business day; the app is connected and "Pro Referral" is enabled → the worker dials within ~1 minute. Sara: "Hi {name}, this is Sara from {company} — you asked about your {problem}…", offers 2–3 engine slots, the customer picks one → schedule-hold written to the lead, chain closes `booked`, the call (recording/transcript/summary) is on the Pulse timeline, the lead card shows the held window.
- **SC-02 (no answer → ladder → dispatcher task).** Same lead, nobody answers. Attempt 1 immediate, attempt 2 at +30 min, attempt 3 at +2 h (all within hours, else carried to the next business-day start). After the 3rd failure the chain closes `exhausted` and a dispatcher task "Couldn't reach the lead" appears bound to the lead; all three attempts are visible in Pulse.
- **SC-03 (out-of-hours lead).** A lead is created Saturday 22:40 (company works Mon–Sat 08:00–18:00) → no dial that night; the first attempt fires Monday at 08:00 company time.
- **SC-04 (goal achieved between retries).** After a no-answer, the customer calls back and Sara inbound (or a dispatcher) books the lead → the pending retry is skipped at claim time (hold set / lead closed) and the chain closes without dialing.
- **SC-05 (no phone).** A configured-source lead arrives without a dialable phone → no chain starts; a timestamped trace line is appended to the lead's **Comments** ("[AI Phone] Outbound call skipped — no phone number on the lead"), visible on the Lead card.
- **SC-06 (source not configured).** A Thumbtack lead arrives while only "Pro Referral" is enabled → nothing happens (no chain, no trace).
- **SC-07 (connect / settings / disconnect).** The owner connects the app on `/settings/integrations` → the settings page appears with the source multi-select ("Pro Referral" preselected). Disconnecting stops new chains immediately and cancels queued attempts; leads created while disconnected are NEVER dialed later, even after reconnect (FR-14).
- **SC-08 (customer answered but did not book).** The customer answers and declines / asks for a human / can't decide → NO further auto-redial (a human conversation happened); the chain closes `declined` and a dispatcher follow-up task with the call summary is created on the lead.
- **SC-09 (dispatcher visibility).** A dispatcher watches the attempt live in the Pulse timeline (live row → finalize with recording/transcript/summary), exactly like parts-robot calls (OUTBOUND-CALL-TIMELINE-001).

### 3. Functional Requirements

- **FR-1 (marketplace app).** New catalog row (proposed `app_key='outbound-lead-caller'`, name **"Outbound Lead Caller"**, category `lead_generation`-adjacent per Architect, `app_type='internal'`, `provider_name='Albusto'`, published), seeded idempotently by `app_key` and registered in `ensureMarketplaceSchema` AFTER 083 (boot-reseed ordering precedent). Per-company connect/disconnect via the existing generic tile + `metadata.setup_path` settings page (Mail Secretary precedent). Connect requires no external credential (internal app; VAPI config is server-env).
- **FR-2 (settings = enabled sources).** The settings page holds a per-company **multi-select of lead sources**: options = union of the canonical `JOB_SOURCES` list (`frontend/src/components/leads/editLeadHelpers.ts`) and the DISTINCT non-empty `job_source` values present on the company's leads (prod reality check: leads arrive as "Pro Referral" with a space, while the canon says "ProReferral"). **Matching is normalized** (trim, collapse whitespace, case-insensitive → "ProReferral" ≡ "Pro Referral"). Default on first connect: **Pro Referral enabled** (D5). Settings persist per company and survive restarts; changes take effect for leads created AFTER the change.
- **FR-3 (trigger).** On `lead.created` (eventBus, `backend/src/services/leadsService.js`): if the company has the app **connected** AND the lead's `job_source` normalized-matches an **enabled** source AND the lead has a **dialable phone** (E.164-normalizable) → start ONE outbound call chain for that lead. Missing/undialable phone → NO chain; append a timestamped **"[AI Phone] Outbound call skipped — no phone number on the lead"** line to the lead's Comments (append-only, never overwrite) — the visible trace of SC-05. Non-matching source or disconnected app → no action, no trace.
- **FR-4 (immediate dial + business-hours window).** Attempt 1 is scheduled **immediately** when the trigger fires inside business hours (dispatch settings `work_days`, `work_start_time`–`work_end_time`, company timezone); otherwise at the **next business-day `work_start_time`**. NO attempt (first or retry) may ever dial outside the window: the window is enforced at claim/execution time, and an out-of-window due attempt is carried to the next window start, not dropped.
- **FR-5 (retry ladder, scenario-scoped config).** Failure-to-reach outcomes re-schedule per the ladder **immediate / +30 min / +2 h** (relative to the failed attempt), `max_attempts=3`, offsets clamped into business hours (an offset past `work_end_time` lands at the next business-day start). Config per company via the `outbound_call_settings` mechanism (safe-fail `resolve`, never throws), **scoped to this scenario** so the parts-robot ladder is untouched — the Architect picks the shape (scenario column / second table / JSONB), the requirement is: two independent ladders, one resolve seam each.
- **FR-6 (goal-achieved skip — D3 exception).** At claim time, BEFORE dialing, every attempt re-checks the lead: schedule-hold present (`LeadDateTime` set) OR status closed (`Lost`/`Converted` — the existing open-lead definition in `leadsService`) OR lead deleted → skip the dial, close the chain (`canceled`/goal-achieved reason), no dispatcher task. This is NOT a human-takeover guard: an ongoing dispatcher call, an open softphone, or a recent human note never cancels the chain (D3).
- **FR-7 (call placement + context injection).** Reuse `outboundCallService.placeCall` semantics (VAPI `POST /call`, safe-fail, registered `VAPI_OUTBOUND_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` or transient-Twilio caller-ID, no secret leakage). `assistantOverrides.variableValues` carries the lead context: **`leadUuid`, `companyId`, `customerName`, `zip`, `problemDescription`** (lead description/comments-derived), `source` label, scenario discriminator, plus the pre-computed top slot (FR-9). Server-injected values are authoritative — `vapi-tools.buildSkillInput` spreads `variableValues` LAST, so the model can never override identity (Yelp injection-hardening precedent).
- **FR-8 (conversation goal — same Sara, new scenario).** The SAME outbound VAPI assistant as parts calls gains a **`scenario` discriminator** (e.g. `lead_booking` vs the existing parts flow) selecting the lead-booking script: greet by name referencing the source inquiry and the problem, confirm/qualify against the injected context (zip → `checkServiceArea` only when needed; no re-verification of data we already have), offer engine-ranked windows via `recommendSlots` (slot-engine with TECH-DAYOFF-001 day-off seam and nearest-fallback), and on the customer's pick write the **schedule-hold on the TRIGGERING lead** (`leadUuid`-scoped; `LeadDateTime`/`LeadEndDateTime` semantics identical to VAPI-SLOT-ENGINE-001/`bookOnLead`; booking accepted only for a `slotKey` the engine actually offered). No new lead and no job is ever created by this flow; the existing parts scenario must remain byte-identical in behavior.
- **FR-9 (pre-computed slot; never dial empty-handed).** Before each dial the worker pre-computes the top slot via `recommendSlots` (D3 precedent of the parts robot: the call opens with a concrete window, no API hit at call-open; alternatives are pulled live in-call). Slot-engine error or zero slots → the attempt is NOT dialed and is treated as a technical failure in the ladder (FR-5); if that persists through the final attempt, the FR-12 task states the real reason ("couldn't compute slots" vs "couldn't reach").
- **FR-10 (outcome classification).** Every attempt ends in exactly one recorded outcome: **`booked` / `no_answer` / `voicemail` / `declined` / `failed`** (placement or technical error), classified from the existing VAPI end-of-call webhook seam (`endedReason` + booking evidence), same statuses vocabulary as `outbound_call_attempts` today.
- **FR-11 (ladder vs terminal outcomes).** `no_answer` / `voicemail` / `failed` → next ladder step (or exhaustion). `booked` → chain closes successfully, no task. `declined` (a human answered but did not book — incl. "call me later"/"send a human") → chain closes with NO further auto-redial and a dispatcher follow-up task on the lead carrying the call summary. Voicemail: the attempt counts as unreached; leaving a voicemail message is out of scope v1.
- **FR-12 (exhaustion task).** After the final failed attempt the chain closes `exhausted` and ONE dispatcher task ("Couldn't reach the lead — {N} attempts") is created, bound to the lead (existing Tasks system; opens the lead card), carrying per-attempt timestamps/outcomes. Exactly one task per chain (idempotent create).
- **FR-13 (Pulse visibility).** Every dialed attempt is mirrored to the Pulse timeline by the EXISTING `vapiCallTimelineService` flow (placement → live row → finalize with recording/transcript/summary; `vapi:<id>` → real CallSid re-key) — zero new timeline code expected; requirement is that lead-scenario calls flow through the same seam.
- **FR-14 (idempotency + no backfill).** (a) At most ONE active chain per lead — a partial-unique guard analogous to the parts `uq_outbound_call_attempts_active_job`, keyed by the lead; duplicate `lead.created` deliveries or hook re-entry must not double-dial. (b) Connecting/re-enabling the app or adding a source NEVER dials pre-existing leads: only `lead.created` events observed while the app is connected AND the source enabled start chains (activation-gate precedent MAIL-AGENT-002). (c) A lead gets at most one chain lifetime-wise unless a dispatcher explicitly re-triggers (explicit re-trigger UI is out of scope v1).
- **FR-15 (disconnect / source-off mid-chain).** Eligibility is re-checked at claim time: app disconnected or the lead's source no longer enabled → the pending attempt is canceled (chain closes `canceled`, no task, no dial). Disconnect therefore stops queued work without racing the worker tick.

### 4. Non-functional Requirements

- **N-1 (multi-tenant).** Everything company-scoped (`company_id` on chains/settings; worker claim, slot calls, hold writes, tasks, timeline all tenant-filtered). No cross-company dialing under any misconfiguration.
- **N-2 (safe-fail worker).** No error (missing lead, VAPI fault, engine fault, settings fault, comments-append hiccup) may crash the worker tick, corrupt another chain, or break the parts-robot chains sharing the infra. Decision points (skip/carry/cancel reasons) are logged structuredly.
- **N-3 (latency).** An eligible in-hours lead is dialed within ~1 worker tick (≤ ~60 s) of `lead.created`.
- **N-4 (permissions).** Settings page gated like existing marketplace settings pages (admin/settings-level); no new permission catalog entries expected. Timeline rows follow existing `pulse.view`; tasks follow existing tasks RBAC.
- **N-5 (config safety).** Missing VAPI env (`VAPI_API_KEY` / `VAPI_OUTBOUND_ASSISTANT_ID` / caller-number config) → safe-fail, no dial, clear log (`vapi_config_missing` precedent); the chain fails technically rather than silently disappearing.
- **N-6 (observability).** Per-attempt rows (status, scheduled_at, outcome reason) queryable in the DB; skip/carry decisions carry machine-readable reasons; grep-able log prefix for the scenario. No new dashboard v1.
- **N-7 (UI language/brand).** All new user-visible strings English, Albusto-branded, no "Blanc"; settings page follows FORM-CANON (right-side panel, floating fields, tokens only).

### 5. Constraints & Dependencies

- **Reuse, do not fork:** `outbound_call_attempts` (+ its worker claim/backoff/webhook classification), `outboundCallService.placeCall`, `outboundCallSettingsService` mechanism, `vapiCallTimelineService`, agentSkills (`recommendSlots`/`checkServiceArea`/hold-write path), dispatch-settings business-hours source, marketplace connect + settings-page pattern. The Architect decides lead-chain storage (extend `outbound_call_attempts` with a nullable lead key vs parallel table) — the FR-14 per-lead active-uniqueness and the untouched job-guard semantics are the hard requirements.
- **Same assistant, live-edit discipline:** the outbound assistant is edited via REST PATCH (CLI panics; live config DRIFTS — GET before PATCH; re-inject `VAPI_TOOLS_SECRET` on model writes). Prompt/scenario changes are deploy-time-gated by owner consent like all prod pushes.
- **Slot recommendations require the `smart-slot-engine` marketplace app** (existing gate) and the slot-engine container (separate service) — without them FR-9 refuses to dial (technical-failure path), it must not bypass the gate.
- **Booking = lead hold only.** No Zenbooker write at booking time (the hold lives on the lead; ZB is touched later at lead→job conversion, existing flow). No FSM/job-status change.
- **Autonomous mode (telephony) gates INBOUND only** — it does not block this outbound scenario (consistent with the parts robot). If the owner ever wants a global outbound kill-switch, that is the app's disconnect.
- **Yelp source caution:** enabling "Yelp" here would run the voice robot alongside the Yelp EMAIL convo agent on the same leads. v1 does not special-case or block it — operator decision; document in the settings page copy ("Yelp leads are already handled by the email booking agent").
- **Migration numbering:** next free number (≥172 at time of writing) — renumber at implementation per the parallel-worktree rule.
- **Compliance note:** business-hours window is the only calling-time restriction v1 (owner-accepted); TCPA-style DNC lists are out of scope (below).

### 6. Out of Scope (explicit)

- Lead sources beyond the configured multi-select; auto-enabling new sources.
- SMS fallback / follow-up texts after failed attempts; post-call drip campaigns.
- Human-takeover cancellation of the chain (owner explicitly rejected CANCEL-001-style guards for this flow — D3).
- Leaving voicemail messages; answering-machine scripts.
- DNC / do-not-call list management and quiet-hours compliance beyond the business-hours window.
- Dispatcher "re-run the robot" button on the lead card (chains start only from `lead.created` in v1).
- Coupling with the per-source lead-ingestion apps (MARKETPLACE-LEADGEN-SPLIT-001) or per-source ingestion enforcement.
- Any change to the parts-robot scenario, its ladder defaults, or CANCEL-001 behavior.
- Backfill dialing of leads created before the app/source was enabled.

### 7. Potentially Involved Modules (по architecture.md)

- `backend/src/services/outboundCallWorker.js` — extend: claim/execute lead-scenario attempts (window carry, goal-achieved skip, eligibility re-check).
- `backend/src/services/outboundCallService.js` — extend: lead-context variableValues (leadUuid/zip/problem/scenario) without disturbing the parts call body.
- `backend/src/services/outboundCallSettingsService.js` — extend: scenario-scoped resolve (lead ladder defaults immediate/+30m/+2h).
- `backend/src/services/leadsService.js` — trigger hook consumer on `lead.created` (emit side unchanged); Comments append trace.
- `backend/src/services/agentSkills/*` — reuse; hold-write path scoped to the triggering `leadUuid`.
- `backend/src/routes/vapi-*` webhook seam — outcome classification for the new scenario.
- `backend/db/migrations/<next>_outbound_lead_call.sql` (+ rollback) — chain storage/uniqueness + app catalog seed (+ `ensureMarketplaceSchema` registration in `backend/src/db/marketplaceQueries.js`).
- `frontend/src/pages/` — new settings page (setup_path), route registration; `IntegrationsPage.tsx` untouched (generic tile).
- `voice-agent/assistants/*.json` — outbound assistant scenario/prompt update (repo mirror of the live PATCH).

### 8. Integrations Affected

- **VAPI** — assistant prompt PATCH (scenario discriminator) + outbound `POST /call` volume for lead chains.
- **Twilio** — caller-ID leg (registered VAPI number or transient BYO number), unchanged mechanism.
- **Slot-engine service** — `recommendSlots` volume (pre-dial + in-call), existing gate.
- **Zenbooker / Front / Gmail / Stripe / Google Places** — none (no ZB write at hold time; `validateAddress` only if the conversation needs it).

### 9. Protected Parts (DO NOT BREAK)

- The parts-robot chain end-to-end: job-scoped `outbound_call_attempts` semantics, `uq_outbound_call_attempts_active_job`, its ladder defaults, TASK-ACTIONS buttons, CANCEL-001 behavior.
- Inbound Sara (assistant `30e85a87`), callflow routing (CALLFLOW-BUSY-TO-AGENT-001), and the inbound `/api/vapi-tools` contract (`buildSkillInput` spread order is load-bearing).
- `leadsService.createLead(fields, companyId)` signature and the `lead.created` event contract (`eventCatalog.js`); external lead ingestion `POST /leads` (`integrations-leads.js`) — read-only consumers.
- `vapiCallTimelineService` re-key/finalize logic and Pulse list CTEs (PULSE-PERF-001 discipline).
- Slot-engine container + `slotEngineService` seam (TECH-DAYOFF-001) — consume, don't modify.
- Marketplace seeds/lifecycle of existing apps and `ensureMarketplaceSchema` ordering; protected files list (`src/server.js`, `authedFetch.ts`, `useRealtimeEvents.ts`).

## RELY-LEADS-SETTINGS-001 — Rely Leads settings (service area / unit types / brands) + ingest acceptance filtering with rejected-lead marker (2026-07-13)

> Status: requirements (Product 01). Builds directly on **MARKETPLACE-LEADGEN-SPLIT-001** (migration 169, master, UNDEPLOYED — owner-gated) and REUSES the **SERVICE-TERR-002** containment seam. Binding owner decisions from the interview are baked in and marked **[OWNER]**. This feature deliberately supersedes LEADGEN-SPLIT NFR-5 ("zero frontend work") for the `rely-leads` tile ONLY, and is the first step of the "per-source behavior" follow-up that LEADGEN-SPLIT FR-6 declared out of scope — but it is a lead-ACCEPTANCE filter, NOT ingestion enforcement (disconnect still doesn't block; rejected leads are still created).

**Краткое описание.** The connected **Rely Leads** marketplace tile gets a **Settings** button opening a right-side slide-over panel (FORM-CANON) with three AND-combined lead-acceptance filters: **(L1) service area** — radio "Same as company settings" (SERVICE-TERR-002: ZIP list OR radius-from-base per `company_territory_settings.active_mode`) vs "Custom ZIP list" (free-form input, any separators); **(L2) unit types** — checkboxes over a fixed 12-entry catalog; **(L3) brands** — checkboxes over a fixed 15-entry catalog. A Rely (insurance) lead — `POST /api/v1/integrations/leads` with `JobSource='Rely'` — is ACCEPTED only if it passes all three. A failing lead is **still created** (normal path, default status `Submitted`) but carries a **rejected marker with a reason** (`out_of_area` / `unit_not_serviced` / `brand_not_serviced`) — visible and countable in the Leads UI, excluded from the new-leads nav badge. Non-Rely ingestion stays byte-identical; the whole filter is fail-open on any internal error.

### Verified code/schema facts (downstream agents: do NOT re-derive, do NOT contradict)

- **Ingest contract:** `POST /api/v1/integrations/leads` (`backend/src/routes/integrations-leads.js:33`) = `rejectLegacyAuth → validateHeaders → authenticateIntegration → rateLimiter` + `requireIntegrationScope('leads:create')`; company = `req.integrationCompanyId`; calls `leadsService.createLead(payload, companyId)`; contact-dedup + address-sync wrap it non-blocking; response `201 {success, lead_id, serial_id, contact_id, request_id}`.
- **Payload field names** (`FIELD_MAP`, `leadsService.js:132-164`, PascalCase API → snake_case column): **`PostalCode`→`postal_code`**, **`Description`→`lead_notes`**, **`JobSource`→`job_source`**, `Status`→`status`. Rely discriminator = payload **`JobSource === 'Rely'`** (prod 90-day `job_source`: Rely=57) — the token CANNOT discriminate (all five sources share `api_integration_id=1` per mig 169), only `job_source` can. Brand/unit exist ONLY as free-text `Description` lines **`Brand: Kenmore`** / **`Issue: Dishwasher`** (Brand often ABSENT); there are NO structured unit/brand payload fields.
- **Status model:** `leads.status VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Submitted'` (mig 004:11). `createLead` does NO FSM validation on INSERT; `updateLead` validates via `fsmService.resolveTransition` only when Status CHANGES, and with a published lead FSM an unknown `currentState` returns `valid:false` "State not found" (`fsmService.js:620-623`) → **a lead created in a non-FSM status (e.g. 'Rejected') would be permanently STUCK**. Default-co published lead FSM states (073+095): Review, Submitted, New, Contacted, Proposal Sent, … — **NO Rejected-like state exists**. FSM = per-company published SCXML — NO FSM changes allowed in this feature.
- **`leads.metadata` JSONB exists** (mig 007) and already flows to API DTOs via the `rowToLead` spread (`leadsService.js:100`). ⚠️ `extractCustomMetadata` (`leadsService.js:108-127`) merges the EXTERNAL payload's flat registered keys AND its `Metadata` object into `leads.metadata` — an external poster can write arbitrary registered keys there.
- **Badge:** `NEW_LEAD_STATUSES=['Submitted','New','Review']`; `countNewLeads` = `status = ANY(...) AND lead_lost=false` (`leadsService.js:1284-1296`) feeding `GET /api/leads/new-count` → nav badge (SSE-triggered refetch). A rejected-but-`Submitted` lead WOULD count unless the count query excludes the marker. AR flows are task-based (tasks.thread_id, Pulse); integrations ingest creates NO tasks → no AR interaction.
- **Leads UI:** `LeadsPage` = filterable table (no Kanban); unknown statuses render with a gray fallback (`LEAD_STATUS_COLORS[Status] || '#6B7280'`), filter options come from FSM states else static `LEAD_STATUSES` (`frontend/src/types/lead.ts:192`); `listLeads only_open` excludes only Lost/Converted → a `Submitted` rejected lead shows in the default list view.
- **Territory seam (REUSE, no edit):** `territoryService.isZipInTerritory(companyId, query)` — `company_territory_settings.active_mode 'list'|'radius'` (row absent ⇒ `'list'`, `territoryRadiusQueries.getSettings`); list → `serviceTerritoryQueries.search` (normalizeZip, zip/city/address tolerant); radius → `territoryGeoService.geocodeZip` (zip_geocache-first, Google Geocoding on miss) + haversine vs `territory_radii`; returns `{inside, area, city, state, zip, mode}`. NOTE: `active_mode` lives in `company_territory_settings` (mig 168), NOT in `service_territories` (mig 075).
- **Marketplace storage/routes:** `marketplace_installations.metadata JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` (083:58); mig 169 seeds the default-co `rely-leads` installation with `{"seeded_by":"MARKETPLACE-LEADGEN-SPLIT-001","shared_credential":true}` → settings writes must MERGE, never replace (and mind the `jsonb_set`-missing-parent no-op gotcha, ONBTEL-001 precedent). `/api/marketplace` mount = `authenticate + requirePermission('tenant.integrations.manage') + requireCompanyAccess` (`src/server.js:268` — protected file; new endpoints go INSIDE `backend/src/routes/marketplace.js` under the existing mount, no server.js edit). Existing endpoints: GET /apps, GET /installations, POST install / disconnect / retry-provisioning — **NO installation-settings endpoint exists anywhere today** (grep-verified backend + frontend).
- **IntegrationsPage.tsx:** connected tiles render via the generic branch; per-app buttons exist only for vapi-ai / stripe-payments / google-email / telephony-twilio. A Settings affordance for `rely-leads` is a deliberate NEW per-app case.
- **No unit-type/brand catalog exists in code** (grep Dishwasher / Vent Hood / Speed Queen: only price-book seed strings + voice-agent prose) → the fixed catalogs are NEW constants, single source shared BE/FE.

### Пользовательские сценарии (use cases)

- **US-1 (dispatcher configures a custom zone).** Dispatcher opens Settings on the connected Rely Leads tile → right-side panel → zone radio "Custom ZIP list" → pastes `02301, 02302; 02043` + newline `02744` (any separators) → Save → a later Rely lead with `PostalCode=02744` is accepted; `02888` is rejected `out_of_area`.
- **US-2 (owner relies on company territory, incl. radius mode).** Zone radio stays "Same as company settings" (default). Company switches SERVICE-TERR-002 to radius mode → a Rely lead whose ZIP falls inside any circle is accepted; outside all circles → rejected `out_of_area`. Changing company territory later changes Rely acceptance automatically — no per-app re-save.
- **US-3 (out-of-area insurance lead → visible rejected lead).** A Rely lead outside the area IS created (status `Submitted`, FSM-valid, convert/lost/transitions all work) with rejected marker `out_of_area` → shows in the Leads list with a Rejected chip, reason readable on the lead detail panel ("Rejected — out of service area"); the new-leads nav badge does NOT count it.
- **US-4 (missing brand → accepted).** Unit filter = {Dishwasher}, brand filter = {Whirlpool, GE}. Rely email has `Issue: Dishwasher` and NO `Brand:` line → brand filter passes (missing value ⇒ fail-open), unit passes → lead accepted with no marker.
- **US-5 (settings API tenant isolation).** A user of company B calling GET/PUT settings on company A's installation gets 404 (foreign id) — no cross-tenant read or write; a user without `tenant.integrations.manage` gets 403.
- **US-6 (default-on-deploy).** After deploy, with the owner touching nothing, the connected rely-leads installation has no settings object → defaults apply: **zone='company' ACTIVE immediately**, unit/brand INACTIVE (empty) → the only day-one behavior change is out-of-area rejection of Rely leads **[OWNER]**.

### Функциональные требования

- **FR-1 (storage shape) [OWNER].** Per-company settings live on the company's `rely-leads` `marketplace_installations` row: `metadata.settings = {zone: {mode: 'company'|'custom', custom_zips: string[]}, unit_types: string[], brands: string[]}`. Absent object ⇒ defaults `{zone:{mode:'company',custom_zips:[]},unit_types:[],brands:[]}`. Writes MERGE `metadata` (seeded keys `seeded_by`/`shared_credential` must survive).
- **FR-2 (settings API, company-scoped).** New GET + PUT endpoints INSIDE the existing `/api/marketplace` router (addressing — by installation id or app key — Architect's choice), inheriting `authenticate + requirePermission('tenant.integrations.manage') + requireCompanyAccess`; `company_id` ONLY from `req.companyFilter?.company_id`; foreign installation → 404; non-`rely-leads` installation → 400/404 (settings exist only for this app for now). PUT validates: `mode` ∈ enum; `custom_zips` = unique `normalizeZip`-normalized 5-digit ZIPs; `unit_types`/`brands` ⊆ fixed catalogs (unknown value → 400). GET returns effective (defaults-applied) settings.
- **FR-3 (fixed catalogs, single source BE/FE) [OWNER].** Two code constants, no DB table, no admin UI. **Unit types (12):** Washer, Dryer, Refrigerator, Freezer, Dishwasher, Range, Oven, Cooktop, Microwave, Ice Maker, Garbage Disposal, Vent Hood. **Brands (15):** Whirlpool, GE, Samsung, LG, Maytag, Kenmore, KitchenAid, Frigidaire, Bosch, Electrolux, Amana, Sub-Zero, Viking, Thermador, Speed Queen. (Counts and endpoints Washer…Vent Hood / Whirlpool…Speed Queen are owner-binding; middle entries are product-approved and may be adjusted only by the owner before implementation.) Stored values = exact catalog strings; all matching case-insensitive on trimmed input. One authoritative definition shared by backend and frontend (mechanism — Architect; monorepo has no shared package today).
- **FR-4 (settings panel UI).** A **Settings** button appears on the Rely Leads tile ONLY when its installation is `connected`. It opens a right-side slide-over per FORM-CANON (`DialogContent variant="panel"`, pinned `DialogPanelHeader`, scrollable `DialogBody`, sticky `DialogPanelFooter` with ghost Cancel + primary Save; auto bottom-sheet on mobile). Content: zone radio pair; choosing "Custom ZIP list" reveals a free-form textarea (`FloatingField`) accepting commas/spaces/newlines/semicolons with a live parsed-ZIP count; unit types and brands as `Checkbox` grids under `.blanc-eyebrow` group labels; empty selection shows the literal hint "No filter — all leads accepted". Blanc tokens only.
- **FR-5 (Rely detection + parser).** The filter runs ONLY in the integrations ingest path and ONLY when `payload.JobSource` equals `'Rely'` (case-insensitive, trimmed). Parser inputs (per FIELD_MAP): `zip` = `payload.PostalCode` → `normalizeZip`; `unit` = value of the first `Issue:` line of `payload.Description`; `brand` = value of the first `Brand:` line. Extracted values are matched to catalogs case-insensitively with word-level containment (`Issue: Dishwasher - not draining` ⇒ Dishwasher). A present-but-unrecognized value (matches NO catalog entry) is treated as MISSING for filter purposes.
- **FR-6 (AND semantics + fail-open matrix) [OWNER].** A lead is ACCEPTED iff all three filters pass; evaluation order **zone → unit → brand**; the FIRST failing filter supplies the single reason.
  - *Activity:* zone-company active iff the company has ANY territory data for its active mode (list rows in list mode / radii in radius mode) — **[PRODUCT]** guard: without it a territory-less company would reject every Rely lead on day one; Architect may implement via `countListZips`/`listRadii`. Zone-custom active iff `custom_zips` non-empty. Unit/brand active iff selection non-empty. **Inactive filter ⇒ pass** (empty selection = filter off).
  - *Zone (master):* active + ZIP present → company mode: `isZipInTerritory(companyId, zip).inside`; custom mode: normalized ZIP ∈ `custom_zips`. Active + **ZIP missing → REJECT `out_of_area`** [OWNER]. `inside:false` is a decision, not an error.
  - *Unit / brand:* active + recognized value in selection → pass; active + recognized value NOT in selection → reject (`unit_not_serviced` / `brand_not_serviced`); **value missing or unrecognized → PASS** (fail-open) [OWNER].
  - *Internal error:* ANY thrown exception in the filter (settings read, parse, territory lookup, geocode transport) → ACCEPT and create the lead exactly as today + error log; the response and lead row must be indistinguishable from the pre-feature path.
- **FR-7 (rejected-lead mechanism = non-FSM metadata marker) [OWNER binding, mechanism verified].** Failing leads are created through the NORMAL `createLead` path with the default `Submitted` status (no new status value, no SCXML/fsm_versions change) and a server-side marker in `leads.metadata` (shape ~ `{rely_filter: {rejected: true, reason, evaluated_at, zip, unit, brand}}`; exact key — Architect). Justification (required by binding decision 1): a literal `Rejected` status (a) does not exist in any published lead FSM, (b) would be permanently stuck — `resolveTransition` returns `valid:false` for unknown source states, (c) would require per-company SCXML migrations, which are forbidden here; `markLost`-style direct writes would hide the lead from the default list (`only_open`). The metadata marker keeps the lead fully workable and visible. **Injection guard:** the marker must be written server-side AFTER `extractCustomMetadata` and must be impossible to set or clear via the external payload (`Metadata` object / registered flat keys).
- **FR-8 (visibility + countability).** Leads list rows and mobile cards show a Rejected marker (chip/accent, blanc tokens); the lead detail panel shows the literal reason ("Rejected — out of service area" / "…— unit type not serviced" / "…— brand not serviced"). The leads API exposes the marker in list + detail DTOs (verify the `rowToLead` metadata spread reaches the list DTO). The Leads UI provides a way to see and count rejected leads (minimal shape — e.g. a "Rejected" filter toggle in `LeadsFilterBody` — SpecWriter/Architect pick; no dedicated page).
- **FR-9 (badge exclusion).** `countNewLeads` (`leadsService.js`) excludes rejected-marked leads so the nav badge never counts them; `NEW_LEAD_STATUSES` itself is unchanged; `lead.created` SSE still fires (the client refetches the corrected count). AR flows untouched (no tasks are created by this path).
- **FR-10 (observability).** Exactly one structured log line per evaluated Rely lead: decision (accept/reject), reason, extracted `{zip, unit, brand}`, which filters were active, `company_id`, lead uuid/serial. Fail-open internal errors log at error level with stack.
- **FR-11 (external response contract frozen).** The `POST /leads` response for a REJECTED lead is byte-identical in shape and status code (`201 {success:true, lead_id, serial_id, contact_id, request_id}`) — the Vultr poster never learns about rejection and must not retry.

### Нефункциональные требования

- **NFR-1 (live token + auth chain untouched).** `api_integrations` row 1 never modified; `integrationsAuth` / `integrationScopes` / rate limiting byte-identical (carries over LEADGEN-SPLIT NFR-1).
- **NFR-2 (non-Rely byte-identical).** Payloads with `JobSource ≠ 'Rely'` (or absent) take today's exact path — zero added queries, identical behavior. UI/manual, Yelp, VAPI lead creation untouched: the filter exists ONLY in the integrations ingest path.
- **NFR-3 (no FSM change).** No SCXML edit, no fsm_versions migration, no new status value anywhere; `markLost`/`activateLead`/`convertLead` untouched.
- **NFR-4 (no external-service change).** The Vultr rely-lead-processor is not redeployed or reconfigured; no payload contract change.
- **NFR-5 (performance).** The filter adds **≤1-2 DB queries per Rely lead only** (installation-settings read + one territory/custom-zip check; radius geocode is zip_geocache-first). Rely volume ≈ 57/90 days — no new indexes needed.
- **NFR-6 (security/tenancy).** Settings endpoints follow the Security Rules (company_id only from `req.companyFilter`, foreign → 404); 401/403 + tenant-isolation tests mandatory; no "Blanc" in any new user-visible string.
- **NFR-7 (prospective only).** Settings changes apply to leads ingested AFTER the change; no retro re-evaluation, no background jobs.
- **NFR-8 (installation-state semantics).** No `connected` rely-leads installation for the company ⇒ filter fully INACTIVE (accept-all, today's behavior) — consistent with LEADGEN-SPLIT FR-6 (ingestion is token-gated, not app-gated).

### Open items for the Architect

- **A1 — endpoint addressing + hook placement.** Installation-id vs app-key settings routes; where the Rely branch lives (inside `integrations-leads.js` vs a dedicated filter service called from it) while keeping NFR-2 provable.
- **A2 — marker key + DTO path + injection guard.** Exact `leads.metadata` key, how it reaches list/detail/mobile DTOs, and the guarantee that external payloads can never preset/clear it (see `extractCustomMetadata` merge).
- **A3 — single-source catalog mechanism.** How one constant serves CommonJS backend and TS frontend (shared file, codegen, or test-enforced mirror).
- **A4 — rejected-leads filter UI shape.** Minimal `LeadsFilterBody`/list integration honoring `only_open` semantics.

### Out of scope (explicit)

- Settings for the other lead apps (`pro-referral-leads`, `nsa-leads`, `lhg-leads`, website `lead-generator`) — no Settings button on their tiles.
- Per-source ingestion ENFORCEMENT (disconnect still doesn't block posts) — unchanged from LEADGEN-SPLIT FR-6.
- Catalog admin UI or DB-managed catalogs — catalog edits are code changes.
- Any change to the external Vultr service, its payloads, or `job_source` values.
- Retroactive re-evaluation/backfill of existing leads; scheduled re-checks.
- A dedicated "un-reject" affordance (the lead is fully workable as-is; explicit clear-marker action = possible follow-up).
- Company-territory editing UI (lives in `/settings/service-territories`, SERVICE-TERR-002).
- Yelp / VAPI / manual lead flows and the onboarding checklist.

### Потенциально вовлечённые модули (по architecture.md)

- `backend/src/routes/marketplace.js` — new GET/PUT settings endpoints (inside existing mount; `src/server.js` NOT touched).
- `backend/src/services/marketplaceService.js` — settings read/validate/merge-write helpers.
- `backend/src/routes/integrations-leads.js` + NEW filter/parser service (name per Architect) — the ONLY ingest-path touch (Rely branch).
- NEW shared unit-type/brand catalog constant (BE + FE single source).
- `backend/src/services/leadsService.js` — `countNewLeads` exclusion; rejected marker exposure in list DTO if needed.
- `backend/src/services/territoryService.js` / `territoryRadiusQueries.js` / `serviceTerritoryQueries.js` — REUSE as-is, no edits.
- Frontend: `IntegrationsPage.tsx` (Settings button on rely-leads tile), NEW settings panel component (FORM-CANON), `integrationsApi.ts`, leads marker UI (`LeadsTable.tsx`, `LeadMobileCard.tsx`, `LeadDetailPanel.tsx`, `LeadsFilterBody.tsx`).
- `Docs/*` — this entry + downstream chain.

### Затронутые интеграции

- Google Geocoding — indirectly via the SERVICE-TERR-002 seam (zip_geocache-first, radius mode only, server-side). No direct new calls.
- Twilio / Front / Zenbooker / Gmail / Stripe / VAPI — **none**.
- External lead poster (Vultr rely-lead-processor) — explicitly UNTOUCHED (NFR-4); its token keeps working (NFR-1).

### Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать)

- `api_integrations` row 1 + `integrationsAuth.js` / `integrationScopes.js` / rate-limiter chain — no edits (NFR-1).
- `POST /api/v1/integrations/leads` response envelope and ALL non-Rely behavior — byte-identical (FR-11, NFR-2).
- FSM subsystem (`fsm_versions`, published SCXML, `fsmService.js`) — read-only; no new status values (NFR-3).
- `territoryService.isZipInTerritory` + SERVICE-TERR-002 endpoints/frozen shapes — reuse without modification.
- `NEW_LEAD_STATUSES` list and badge SSE contract (event in BOTH genericEventTypes AND namedEvents — leads-new-badge gotcha); `/new-count` before `/:uuid` route order.
- Seeded `marketplace_installations.metadata` keys (`seeded_by`, `shared_credential`) — must survive settings writes (FR-1).
- Mig 169 contents + LEADGEN-SPLIT shared-credential disconnect guard — build on, don't modify.
- `src/server.js`, `authedFetch.ts`, `useRealtimeEvents.ts` (protected list); `backend/db/` only via this feature's explicit plan (expected: NO new migration — storage reuses `marketplace_installations.metadata` and `leads.metadata`).

## CLIENT-FEEDBACK-WIDGET-001 — In-app product feedback channel (CRM user → Albusto developer)

**Status:** Requirements
**Priority:** P2
**Owner:** Platform / Albusto
**Spec:** `docs/specs/CLIENT-FEEDBACK-WIDGET-001.md`
**Test cases:** `docs/test-cases/CLIENT-FEEDBACK-WIDGET-001.md`

### 1. Description

A globally-mounted floating widget through which **logged-in Albusto CRM users** (employees of tenant
companies) send **product feedback directly to the Albusto developer/owner**. This is explicitly NOT a
business-customer support channel and NOT an internal tenant task — it is a one-way "CRM user → Albusto
developer" pipe. Destination inbox = `support@albusto.com` (forwarded to the developer).

The widget presents a Messenger-style panel. The first line is a **deterministic bot STUB** (rule-based,
NOT AI): it greets, answers with canned lines, and always shows a "Talk to a human" button. On explicit
"human" click OR after N (default 2) canned replies it escalates: the bot posts a normative line and reveals
an in-panel form (email prefilled + editable, "What happened?" textarea, optional attachments). On Send the
submission is persisted to a new `feedback_submissions` table (source of truth) and a best-effort email is
sent to the feedback inbox. This is a **new feature**; no existing feature covers it.

Checked `requirements.md` for duplication: EMAIL-001 (tenant Gmail workspace), MAIL-AGENT-001 (inbound mail
triage → dispatcher tasks), TASKS (cross-entity tenant tasks), YELP-* (business-customer channels) — none is
a CRM-user→developer product-feedback channel. No overlap.

### 2. User scenarios

- **SC-01 — Feedback via escalation form (happy path):** Logged-in user clicks the floating chat button →
  panel opens with a bot greeting + "Talk to a human". User clicks "Talk to a human" (or sends ≥2 messages) →
  bot posts *"Okay — leave your details below and we'll get back to you"* and shows the form. Email is
  prefilled from the user's account (editable). User writes "What happened?", optionally attaches ≤5 files,
  clicks Send → success confirmation. A `feedback_submissions` row is created and a best-effort email with
  attachments is sent to the feedback inbox.
- **SC-02 — Escalation by message count:** User types two messages; the bot replies with canned lines and, on
  reaching the threshold, auto-escalates to the form without needing the "human" button.
- **SC-03 — Bot-only, no submission:** User chats with the stub and closes the panel without escalating. No
  DB row, no email.
- **SC-04 — Validation failure:** User submits with an invalid email, an empty message, or a file that
  violates the size/count/mime limits → the request is rejected (422) and the user sees an inline error; no
  row is created.
- **SC-05 — Email transport unavailable/failing:** The DB row is created successfully; the best-effort email
  fails (no platform mailbox connected, or Gmail error). The user still sees success (truth = the persisted
  row); the failure is logged only. No data is lost.

### 3. Non-functional / constraints

- Audience = authenticated CRM users only. Floating button mounts globally in `AppLayout` (visible to every
  logged-in user), suppressed on `/signup` and `/onboarding` (which already bypass the app chrome).
- **Reliability:** the submission MUST NOT be lost. The DB row is the source of truth; email is best-effort
  and its failure must never fail the request.
- Do NOT create a task in the tenant's Pulse. Do NOT ask for a phone number.
- File limits: ≤5 files, ≤10 MB each, mime allowlist = pdf / png / jpg / gif / webp / txt.
- Copy is English, warm (tone per ONBOARDING-UX-001). No "Blanc" string anywhere in UI.
- Feature flag `VITE_FEATURE_FEEDBACK_WIDGET` (default on in dev).
- Design canon: `--blanc-*` tokens, `FloatingField`, no block-in-block, mobile 375 (narrow panel that never
  covers the bottom nav / softphone).
- Company isolation: `feedback_submissions.company_id` NOT NULL FK; every query company-scoped.

### 4. Modules / integrations involved

- Backend (new): `backend/db/migrations/170_feedback_submissions.sql` (+ rollback),
  `backend/src/db/feedbackQueries.js`, `backend/src/services/feedbackService.js`,
  `backend/src/routes/feedback.js`; mount in `src/server.js`.
- Backend (reused): `backend/src/services/emailService.js` `sendEmail(companyId,{to,files,…})`,
  `backend/src/services/emailMailboxService.js` (platform-sender mailbox), `multer` memoryStorage.
- Frontend (new): `frontend/src/components/feedback/FeedbackWidget.tsx` (+ CSS); mount in
  `frontend/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`.
- Frontend (reused): `useAuth()` (`user.email`), `authedFetch`/`apiClient`, `ui/floating-field.tsx`.
- Integrations: Gmail (best-effort outbound only, via the platform-sender company mailbox). Twilio / Front /
  Zenbooker / Stripe — none.

### 5. Protected code (do not break)

- `src/server.js` core middleware/SSE shell (only ADD the new `app.use('/api/feedback', …)` mount).
- `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`, `frontend/src/hooks/useRealtimeEvents.ts` — untouched.
- `backend/db/` existing schema — only ADD migration 170; no changes to existing tables.
- `emailService.sendEmail` signature — reused as-is, not modified.
- `AppLayout` existing render tree (softphone, warm-up modal, nav badges) — only ADD the widget mount.

### 6. Key open question resolved by the Architect

Platform email transport: `emailService.sendEmail` is bound to the **tenant company's** Gmail mailbox, but
feedback must reach `support@albusto.com` regardless of whether the tenant connected Gmail. See the
Architecture section for the resolution (no system SMTP transport exists in the backend → DB row = guarantee,
email = best-effort via the platform-sender company mailbox).


## RATE-ME-CRM-001 — Rate Me becomes a multi-tenant CRM marketplace app: per-tenant rating storage + public technician-rating page on rate.albusto.com or the tenant's own domain (CNAME), infrastructure phase (2026-07-13)

> Status: requirements (Product 01). NEW feature — no RATE-ME entry exists anywhere in requirements/code (grep-verified: zero `rate-me`/`rate_me` hits in backend/frontend/src/migrations). This is the **infrastructure phase only**: data model, public token API, public page, dedicated + custom-domain hosting, marketplace app + settings. **SMS sending, job-Done triggers, referrals, rewards, and any ratings-VIEWING UI are OUT OF SCOPE (later phases).** Binding owner decisions from the interview are marked **[OWNER]**: (1) option-A host = DEDICATED `rate.albusto.com`, which is ALSO the CNAME target for option B; (2) custom-domain verification = CNAME-only — one DNS record, we check resolution; (3) happy threshold = **5★ ONLY** → redirect to the company's Google-review link, 1–4★ → internal feedback textarea → thank-you (threshold NOT configurable this phase); (4) ratings are STORED only (no viewing UI this phase).

**Краткое описание.** The Rate Me rating engine (today a single-tenant page in the legacy lead-engine stack) becomes part of the multi-tenant CRM as a marketplace app (`rate-me`). Every tenant gets its OWN isolated rating system: opaque crypto tokens tied to (company, job, technician), a mobile-first branded public rating page, and per-company rating storage. The public page is hosted (A) on a new dedicated `rate.albusto.com` or (B) on the tenant's OWN domain, connected through a humane DNS form in the Rate Me app settings (one CNAME record pointing at `rate.albusto.com`; Caddy issues the certificate on demand via an ask-endpoint that authorizes ONLY verified domains). A 5★ rating immediately redirects the customer to the company's Google-review link (a new Rate Me setting); 1–4★ opens an internal feedback textarea and ends on a thank-you. Ratings and feedback are stored per company and are NOT surfaced anywhere in the CRM yet.

### Verified code/schema facts (downstream agents: do NOT re-derive, do NOT contradict)

- **Migration numbering:** latest file = `171_timeline_revpage_call_page_index.sql` → **next free = 172**. ⚠️ Header comments LIE about numbers after parallel-branch renumbering (170's header says "Migration 169", 123's header says "Migration 119") — the FILENAME is authoritative.
- **Marketplace settings scaffold (RELY-LEADS-SETTINGS-001, implemented, tests green):** `GET/PUT /api/marketplace/apps/:appKey/settings` (`backend/src/routes/marketplace.js:50-75`) under the mount `authenticate + requirePermission('tenant.integrations.manage') + requireCompanyAccess` (`src/server.js:268`, protected file — new settings behavior goes INSIDE marketplace.js). Whitelist = `SETTINGS_ENABLED_APP_KEYS = new Set(['rely-leads'])` (`backend/src/services/marketplaceService.js:36`); `resolveSettingsInstallation` = whitelist → published app → **connected installation, else 404**. ⚠️ Validation and response are currently **Rely-HARDCODED** (`validateRelySettingsInput`, `buildSettingsResponse` unconditionally return rely settings/catalogs/territory) → adding `rate-me` REQUIRES a per-app-key dispatch refactor with rely behavior byte-identical (suites `tests/relyLeadsSettings*.js` must stay green). Storage: `marketplaceQueries.setInstallationSettings` = `metadata || jsonb_build_object('settings', $3)` — top-level MERGE (seeded keys survive) but **`metadata.settings` is REPLACED wholesale** → PUT must send the full settings object. Audit precedent: `marketplaceQueries.writeEvent(eventType: 'settings_updated')`.
- **App-seed precedent:** mig 161 (`ai-repair-advisor`) = gate-only app, `provisioning_mode='none'`, NO credential, generic install path creates the `marketplace_installations` row (which settings storage needs); mig 170 = idempotent INSERT pattern. `isAppConnected(companyId, appKey)` generic path = published app + active installation `status='connected'`.
- **Public token-page precedent (`/e/:token`, SEND-DOC-001):** the page is a **route inside the MAIN SPA build** (`frontend/src/App.tsx:112` → `PublicEstimateViewPage`), NOT a separate build. Keycloak is bypassed via `PUBLIC_AUTH_PATHS = ['/signup', '/pay', '/e']` (`frontend/src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx:192`). Backend = unauthenticated router `backend/src/routes/public-estimates.js` mounted at `/api/public` in `src/server.js:239-246` BEFORE authed routers; token guard `TOKEN_RE = /^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{6,64}$/` + uniform 404 `Invalid link`. SPA + API are ONE Express on `:3000` (`express.static` + `index.html` catch-all, `src/server.js:355-368`, `PORT=3000`, listens 0.0.0.0); Caddy proxies `app.albusto.com, api.albusto.com → 127.0.0.1:3000`. Public DTO minimalism precedent: `getPublicEstimate` returns company_name + doc fields ONLY, no ids.
- ⚠️ **Estimate tokens are only 64-bit** (`crypto.randomBytes(8).toString('base64url')`, `estimatesService.js:695`) — rate tokens must NOT copy this; ≥128 bit required (NFR-1).
- **Technicians:** there is NO technicians table. Technician identity = **Zenbooker TEXT id**. Truth = `jobs.assigned_techs` JSONB (`t->>'id'`, `t->>'name'`); display name = `COALESCE(technician_profiles.name, assigned_techs name)` via `technicianProfilesService` (`backend/src/services/technicianProfilesService.js`; table `technician_profiles`, mig 123: `company_id UUID + tech_id TEXT UNIQUE(company_id,tech_id)`, `name` override, `photo_storage_key`) — built FOR the public payment page (`/pay/:token`), i.e. the exact precedent to REUSE for the rating page's display name. `technician_base_locations` (mig 125) and `technician_time_off` (mig 167) use the same `(company_id, tech_id TEXT)` key.
- **Company branding:** `companies` table — `name`, `logo_storage_key` (mig 134); `companyProfileService.getProfile` → `logo_url` = **presigned S3 URL** (`storageService.getPresignedUrl`, default TTL 1h), best-effort `null` on presign failure (a broken logo must not break the page).
- **Edge/Caddy:** `infra/Caddyfile` = in-repo REFERENCE copy; live `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` is authoritative; apply/rollback = MANUAL procedure per `infra/README.md` (changelog 2026-07: "Infra now tracked"). TODAY the Caddyfile has **NO `rate.albusto.com` block and NO `on_demand_tls` anywhere** — both are NEW in this feature. Existing blocks: albusto.com static, app/api → :3000 (with `handle_path /apps/leads* → :4001` precedent), auth → :8081.
- **Public rate-limit precedent:** `express-rate-limit` per-IP in `backend/src/routes/publicAuth.js` (`limiter(max)`, 20–120/min per endpoint).

### Пользовательские сценарии (use cases)

- **US-1 (happy path, option A, Google link configured).** Customer opens the tokenized link on `rate.albusto.com` → mobile page with the company's logo + name and the technician's display name → taps **5★** → the rating is recorded server-side, then the browser immediately redirects to the company's Google-review link.
- **US-2 (unhappy path, internal feedback).** Customer taps **3★** → an internal feedback textarea appears ("What could we have done better?") → submits (text optional) → thank-you screen. Stars + feedback are stored under the company; NO Google redirect, nothing posted publicly.
- **US-3 (one-time / replay semantics).** Customer re-opens the same link after rating: GET context says `already_rated` → the page shows the thank-you state, no star picker. A direct second POST with the same token returns **200 already-recorded** and the stored rating is UNCHANGED (no overwrite, no error).
- **US-4 (custom domain, option B).** Owner opens Rate Me settings → "Your own domain" → types `rate.bostonmasters.com` → the form shows the EXACT record to create: `Type: CNAME · Host/Name: rate · Target: rate.albusto.com` → owner adds it at the registrar → presses **Verify** → status pending→verified; on the first customer visit Caddy asks our ask-endpoint, gets 200, obtains the certificate → status active, "Your rating page is live at https://rate.bostonmasters.com". The page renders THEIR branding on THEIR domain.
- **US-5 (tenant isolation probe).** A token minted for company B is opened on company A's custom domain → uniform 404. Guessing tokens on `rate.albusto.com` → uniform 404 + per-IP rate limit. Asking Caddy's ask-endpoint about a foreign/unknown domain → silent 404, no certificate ever issued.
- **US-6 (5★ but no Google link configured).** Rating is stored; the page falls back to the thank-you screen (no dead end, no error, no redirect).
- **US-7 (verification failure, humane).** Owner enters a domain but the CNAME doesn't exist yet / points elsewhere / owner typed an apex domain → Verify shows humane copy ("We can't see the CNAME record yet — DNS changes can take up to an hour. Check the record and try again." / "Use a subdomain like rate.your-domain.com — root domains can't carry a CNAME record") with a retry button; the domain is NEVER served (and never gets a certificate) until verified.
- **US-8 (ABC-Homes-later-migration note).** ABC Homes' existing rating page (their Vercel-hosted site on `abchomes-appliance.com`) keeps working, untouched — this phase changes nothing outside the CRM. When ABC Homes later becomes a tenant, option B needs only ONE NEW subdomain CNAME (`rate.abchomes-appliance.com` → `rate.albusto.com`); apex/www stay on Vercel, and the old page can keep running in parallel during the transition.

### Функциональные требования

- **FR-1 (marketplace app `rate-me`).** Migration **172** seeds a `marketplace_apps` row `app_key='rate-me'`, name "Rate Me", `provider_name='Albusto'`, `app_type='internal'`, `provisioning_mode='none'` (no API credential — mig 161 ai-repair-advisor model), `status='published'`; category/copy = Architect draft, owner-refinable. Install/disconnect = the generic marketplace flow (installation row is REQUIRED — it carries settings). The rating engine is **gated per company** on a connected `rate-me` installation (generic `isAppConnected` path).
- **FR-2 (data model, migration 177, additive + idempotent + rollback).**
  - `rate_tokens`: `id`, `company_id UUID NOT NULL → companies`, `token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL` (opaque, ≥128-bit crypto-random, URL-safe base64url), `job_id` (FK per Architect), `tech_id TEXT NOT NULL` (ZB id), `created_at`, `expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL` (NULL = no expiry; nothing mints expiring tokens this phase), `used_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL` (set on first recorded rating). Company-scoped reads everywhere; lookup by exact token match (unique index).
  - `technician_ratings`: `id`, `company_id UUID NOT NULL`, `rate_token_id UNIQUE NOT NULL → rate_tokens` (**DB-level idempotency anchor: one rating per token, ever**), `job_id`, `tech_id TEXT NOT NULL`, `stars SMALLINT NOT NULL CHECK (stars BETWEEN 1 AND 5)`, `feedback TEXT NULL`, `created_at`. STORED ONLY — no CRM read surface this phase [OWNER].
  - `rate_me_domains`: `id`, `company_id UUID NOT NULL`, `domain TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE` (**globally unique**, stored lowercase, punycode-normalized), **`UNIQUE(company_id)`** (exactly one custom domain per company this phase), `status TEXT NOT NULL` lifecycle `pending → verified → active` + failure state `failed` (retryable), `verified_at`, `activated_at`, `last_checked_at`, `last_error TEXT NULL`, timestamps.
- **FR-3 (token mint seam — internal only).** A company-scoped service function `mint(companyId, jobId, techId)` creates a `rate_tokens` row and returns the public URL. **NOT wired to any trigger this phase** (job-Done/SMS = later phases). A permission-gated authed mint endpoint for manual/smoke use MAY be added (Architect) — no UI for it.
- **FR-4 (public GET context by token).** Unauthenticated, rate-limited, token-format pre-check (base64url guard) before any DB read. Returns ONLY: technician display name (COALESCE `technician_profiles.name` → `assigned_techs` name; presentation e.g. first name — page/Architect), company `name`, company `logo_url` (presigned, nullable), `already_rated` boolean, and behavior flags for the page (e.g. `five_star_redirect: true/false` = Google link configured). **NOTHING else leaks:** no company/job/tech/serial ids, no address/phone/status, no Google URL in GET. Unknown / malformed / expired / foreign-host / disconnected-app token → uniform 404 (`Invalid link` model of public-estimates).
- **FR-5 (public POST rating).** Body = `{stars: int 1..5 required, feedback: string optional (trimmed, length-capped ~2000)}`. **Company/job/technician are derived ONLY from the token server-side — NEVER from the body** (extra body fields ignored). First successful POST inserts `technician_ratings` + stamps `rate_tokens.used_at` (atomically; the `rate_token_id UNIQUE` constraint is the race-proof guarantee). Response carries the next step: `{recorded: true, next: 'google_redirect', redirect_url}` (only when `stars=5` AND the link is configured) or `{recorded: true, next: 'thanks'}`. **Replay: second POST for the same token → 200 `{recorded: false, already_recorded: true, next: 'thanks'}` — no overwrite, no error** [OWNER-confirmed semantics]. The redirect URL appears ONLY in the POST response (after recording) — guarantees record-before-redirect.
- **FR-6 (happy-threshold semantics) [OWNER].** Happy = `stars === 5` ONLY, NOT configurable this phase. 5★ → redirect to the company's Google-review link; link missing → thank-you fallback (rating still stored). 1–4★ → feedback textarea → thank-you. The Google-review link is a NEW `rate-me` app setting (FR-9), validated as an absolute `https://` URL.
- **FR-7 (public page).** Mobile-first, branded (company logo + name, technician display name, star picker), served on the rating hosts; path `/r/:token` or `/:token` — **Architect decides**. Interaction: tap 5★ → immediate POST → redirect; tap 1–4★ → textarea + submit (skippable); `already_rated` → thank-you view. Humane copy; NO "Blanc" string; NO CRM navigation/chrome. Serving mechanism (host-gated route in the main SPA — the `/e/:token` precedent, incl. a `PUBLIC_AUTH_PATHS` entry — vs a separate minimal page bundle) = Architect, but NFR-5 (CRM not reachable on rating hosts) is absolute either way.
- **FR-8 (Host-header binding).** The request Host determines tenant scope: on `rate.albusto.com` (option A, shared host) a valid token of ANY tenant resolves; on a custom domain the host MUST match a `verified`/`active` `rate_me_domains` row AND `token.company_id === domain.company_id`, else uniform 404. Unknown host on the rating surface → 404. Exact-host match only (no wildcards; `www.` not auto-included).
- **FR-9 (settings extension on the RELY scaffold).** Add `'rate-me'` to `SETTINGS_ENABLED_APP_KEYS` + introduce a **per-app-key settings dispatch** (validation + response shape per app) keeping `rely-leads` GET/PUT byte-identical. `rate-me` settings stored in `marketplace_installations.metadata.settings`: `{google_review_url: string|null}` (https-validated). **Domain lifecycle state lives in `rate_me_domains`, NOT in metadata** (the ask-endpoint queries by domain); the settings GET response MAY embed the current domain row (single panel payload) — Architect. PUT replaces `metadata.settings` wholesale (scaffold semantics) — FE always sends the full object.
- **FR-10 (custom-domain flow endpoints, authed).** Under the marketplace mount permissions (`tenant.integrations.manage`): set/replace domain (normalize lowercase/trim/punycode; reject invalid hostnames; **reject apex domains with humane copy suggesting `rate.<their-domain>`** — CNAME on apex is not generally possible [PRODUCT]); read state; **Verify** = server-side DNS CNAME resolution of the domain, target equals `rate.albusto.com` → `verified` (else `failed` + humane `last_error`); re-verify allowed anytime; remove domain (row deleted/disabled → ask-endpoint stops authorizing; certificate lapses at renewal). Setting a NEW domain replaces the old binding (UNIQUE(company_id)); a domain already claimed by ANOTHER company → validation error WITHOUT revealing who holds it ("This domain is already in use").
- **FR-11 (activation).** `verified → active` on the first positive ask-endpoint authorization for that domain (or first successful page GET on that host — Architect picks the signal and documents it); UI then shows "Your rating page is live at https://<domain>". `active` and `verified` are BOTH serve-authorized; the split exists purely for humane status copy.
- **FR-12 (Caddy fragment, in-repo + manual apply).** Extend `infra/Caddyfile` (reference) + `infra/README.md` (procedure): (a) NEW `rate.albusto.com` site block → `reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000` (normal managed certificate); (b) NEW catch-all HTTPS site block for customer domains → same reverse_proxy, certificates via **`on_demand_tls` with `ask` pointing at the local ask-endpoint** (global options block; exact syntax/Caddy version on the box — Architect verifies). Applied MANUALLY on deploy (live `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` stays authoritative). Deploy notes: DNS `rate.albusto.com` A-record = owner action in GoDaddy (browser-only, no API — memory constraint).
- **FR-13 (ask-endpoint).** Unauthenticated local HTTP endpoint (mounted like the other public routers; minimal `src/server.js` mount edit — flagged, protected file). Contract: Caddy passes the candidate domain (query param); respond **200** iff the domain row is `verified`/`active` AND the owning company's `rate-me` installation is connected; **else 404**. Responses carry NO details (empty/uniform body both ways). Localhost caller → NOT per-IP throttled into breaking TLS handshakes, but protected by an in-memory decision cache (~60s) + hard cap (Architect). `rate.albusto.com` itself never depends on the ask path (it has its own site block).
- **FR-14 (observability).** Structured logs: domain set/verify attempts (`company_id`, domain, result, error), every ask decision (domain, allow/deny), every rating write (`company_id`, token id, stars, has_feedback, replay flag), sampled/counted public-404s. Marketplace audit events via existing `writeEvent`: `settings_updated` (scaffold) + NEW `domain_added` / `domain_verified` / `domain_activated` / `domain_removed` (shape — Architect).

### Нефункциональные требования

- **NFR-1 (token strength).** ≥128-bit entropy (`crypto.randomBytes(16+)` → base64url), unique-constraint retry on collision; format-guard regex before DB lookup. Explicitly do NOT copy the 64-bit estimate token.
- **NFR-2 (no enumeration).** Uniform 404 for malformed/unknown/expired/foreign-host/app-disconnected tokens — indistinguishable responses; per-IP `express-rate-limit` on public GET (~60/min) and POST (~10/min) (Architect tunes; publicAuth precedent).
- **NFR-3 (tenant isolation).** Every query company-scoped; the token row's `company_id` binds ALL subsequent reads (job/tech/profile/branding); Host-binding per FR-8; NO cross-tenant read path. Mandatory tests: isolation (foreign-host token → 404), replay idempotency, 401/403 on authed settings/domain endpoints, ask-endpoint silence.
- **NFR-4 (ask silence).** 200/404 only; no body detail; never authorizes `pending`/`failed`/removed/foreign domains or disconnected-app companies.
- **NFR-5 (CRM isolation on rating hosts).** `rate.albusto.com` and customer domains must NOT expose the authenticated CRM (SPA routes, `/api/*` beyond the rating surface, Keycloak redirects, CRM cookies). Mechanism (host gate in Express / separate bundle) = Architect; the requirement is absolute.
- **NFR-6 (public payload minimalism).** FR-4's field whitelist is a hard contract; new fields = new requirement. The page shows ONLY the tenant's branding.
- **NFR-7 (performance).** Public GET ≤ ~2-3 queries + one presign; page lightweight/mobile-first (single fetch, no CRM bundles if separate; fast on LTE).
- **NFR-8 (fail behavior).** Logo presign failure → name-only render (companyProfile best-effort precedent); POST storage failure → honest 5xx + "try again" on page (NEVER redirect to Google on failure); DNS-resolver transport errors → `failed` + humane retry copy, never a crash.
- **NFR-9 (deploy safety).** Dark-safe: mig 172 additive; engine install-gated per company; until the Caddy fragment + DNS records are applied (manual owner steps, deploy-consent «да» required) the new hosts simply don't resolve and the CRM is byte-identical. No backfill, no cron.
- **NFR-10 (protected files).** `src/server.js` = minimal mount-only lines under this explicit plan (public rating router, ask-endpoint, host gate if that mechanism is chosen); `authedFetch.ts` / `useRealtimeEvents.ts` untouched; `backend/db/` only via migration 177.

### Open items for the Architect

- **A1 — page path + serving mechanism.** `/r/:token` vs `/:token`; host-gated main-SPA route (+ `PUBLIC_AUTH_PATHS` entry) vs separate minimal bundle; how NFR-5 is enforced for the chosen mechanism.
- **A2 — per-app settings dispatch shape.** Refactor seam for `validateRelySettingsInput`/`buildSettingsResponse` keeping rely suites byte-green; where rate-me validation lives.
- **A3 — domain endpoints addressing.** Inside `/api/marketplace` (app-key-scoped) vs a rate-me-specific router; response embedding of domain state in settings GET.
- **A4 — ask-endpoint path + cache + Caddy specifics.** Exact ask URL, in-memory cache TTL/size, `on_demand_tls` syntax for the Caddy version on the prod box, and the activation signal (FR-11).
- **A5 — CNAME check mechanics.** `dns.promises.resolveCname` primary (owner decision = CNAME-only); behavior behind CDN CNAME-flattening (resolved-A fallback allowed or documented limitation) + resolver timeout policy.
- **A6 — mint seam surface.** Service-only vs additionally a permission-gated authed endpoint for smoke tests; job/tech existence validation at mint time.

### Out of scope (explicit)

- SMS sending and ANY automatic trigger (job-Done etc.) — nothing mints tokens automatically this phase.
- Referrals, rewards, coupons.
- Ratings viewing/analytics UI anywhere in the CRM (stored only) [OWNER]; moderation/deletion of ratings.
- Configurable happy threshold [OWNER: 5★ only]; per-technician Google links.
- Multiple custom domains per company; apex/ANAME/ALIAS support; automatic periodic DNS re-checks; wildcard hosts.
- Any change to the legacy lead-engine rate-me or to ABC Homes' Vercel site (US-8 is a compatibility note, not work).
- Zenbooker writes (technician data is read-only from existing tables/JSONB).

### Потенциально вовлечённые модули (по architecture.md)

- `backend/src/routes/marketplace.js` + `backend/src/services/marketplaceService.js` — whitelist + per-app settings dispatch (FR-9), domain endpoints (FR-10) if placed here.
- NEW `backend/src/routes/public-rate.js` (name per Architect) — public GET/POST + ask-endpoint; NEW `backend/src/services/rateMeService.js` + `backend/src/db/rateMeQueries.js`; migration `backend/db/migrations/172_*.sql`.
- REUSE read-only: `technicianProfilesService` (display name), `companyProfileService`/`storageService` (branding + presign), `marketplaceQueries` (settings write, events), `express-rate-limit` pattern.
- `src/server.js` — mount-only lines (flagged, NFR-10).
- Frontend: `IntegrationsPage.tsx` (Settings affordance on the rate-me tile), NEW `RateMeSettingsDialog` (FORM-CANON panel: Google-link field + domain section with CNAME instructions/status), `marketplaceApi.ts`, NEW public rating page (+ `AuthProvider.tsx` `PUBLIC_AUTH_PATHS` if main-SPA mechanism), `App.tsx` route.
- `infra/Caddyfile` + `infra/README.md` — new blocks + on_demand_tls + apply procedure (FR-12).

### Затронутые интеграции

- **Twilio / Front / Zenbooker / Gmail / Stripe / VAPI — none.** (Technician ids originate from Zenbooker but are read from existing CRM tables/JSONB; no ZB API calls.)
- **Google — redirect-only** (outbound link to the company's Google-review URL; no API).
- **DNS/registrar (GoDaddy)** — owner-side manual records (`rate.albusto.com` A-record; tenant CNAMEs are the tenants' own registrars).
- **Caddy / Let's Encrypt** — NEW on-demand certificate issuance for customer domains (ask-endpoint gated).
- **S3/objects storage** — presigned company-logo reads (existing mechanism).

### Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать)

- `src/server.js`, `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`, `frontend/src/hooks/useRealtimeEvents.ts` (protected list) — server.js gets ONLY the flagged mount lines.
- Existing public routers (`public-estimates.js`, `public-invoices.js`, `publicAuth.js`) and their `/api/public` behavior — byte-identical.
- RELY settings behavior: GET/PUT for `rely-leads` byte-identical through the dispatch refactor (`tests/relyLeadsSettings*.js`, `tests/relyLeadsUi.structural.test.js` stay green); seeded `metadata` keys (`seeded_by`, `shared_credential`) survive.
- Marketplace install/disconnect/credential flows and `marketplace_events` writes — extend, don't modify.
- `technician_profiles` / `technician_base_locations` / `jobs.assigned_techs` shapes — read-only.
- `companies` table — read-only here (no new columns; the Google link lives in installation metadata).
- Existing `infra/Caddyfile` blocks (albusto.com / app+api / auth) — append-only.
- FSM subsystem, leads/jobs flows, Pulse — untouched.

## RATE-ME-CRM-002 — humane, conversion-focused Rate Me page personalized from the job + review→job attribution + rebooking screens + "Send rating link" from the Job card (Phase 2, UX/data — ADDITIVE on the deployed 001) (2026-07-14)

> Status: requirements (Product 01). **Phase 2 of RATE-ME-CRM-001.** The infrastructure — opaque ≥128-bit tokens, the public token API, the `/r/:token` page, the host-gate, the `rate-me` marketplace app + `google_review_url` setting, and migration 177 (`rate_tokens` / `technician_ratings` / `rate_me_domains`, with `rate_tokens.job_id` already persisted) — is **already DEPLOYED**. This phase is purely ADDITIVE UX + data: it (a) makes the public page humane and **personalized from the job**, (b) rewrites `RatePage.tsx` into a **7-screen flow**, (c) turns 5★ into a **new-tab Google review with a click beacon**, (d) adds **token-level attribution** (opened / clicked / sent) surfaced ON the Job card, (e) adds a dispatcher **"Send rating link"** (SMS / Email / Copy) action, and (f) adds a per-company **`booking_url`** rate-me setting for rebooking. **Do NOT break 001** (isolation, uniform-404, replay-idempotency, `google_review_url`, rely-leads settings). Binding owner decisions are marked **[OWNER]** and were locked in the RM2 interview. Notable locks: palette = **Albusto v2 / violet `#7F42E1`** (NOT the warm "Blanc" paper; the word "Blanc" NEVER renders in UI); rating stars = **classic gold** (rating-semantics exception to the one-accent rule); threshold = **exactly 5★, NOT configurable**; **5★ opens Google in a NEW TAB** (`window.open` + beacon, never `location.replace`); **chips are thought-prompts that insert NOTHING into the textarea**; **PII minimal — only the customer FIRST name** leaves the public context.

### Verified code/schema facts (downstream agents: do NOT re-derive, do NOT contradict)

- **Personalization source.** `backend/db/migrations/031_create_jobs.sql`: `service_name TEXT`, `start_date TIMESTAMPTZ`, `customer_name TEXT` (full only), `contact_id BIGINT → contacts(id)`, `assigned_techs JSONB`. `contacts.first_name` exists (mig 025). Resolve first name via `jobs.contact_id → contacts.first_name`; fallback = first whitespace token of `jobs.customer_name`. `jobsService.rowToJob` exposes those fields; `getJobById` does NOT currently join contacts.
- **Extend additively (do NOT rewrite):** `rateMeQueries.getTokenContext` (add `LEFT JOIN jobs j ON j.id = t.job_id` + `LEFT JOIN contacts ct ON ct.id = j.contact_id`; select `first_name`, `service_name`, `start_date`); `rateMeService.getPublicContext` (add fields to the returned object, format the date in the company timezone); `frontend/src/pages/RatePage.tsx` `RateContext` (render them). 001's existing context fields (`company_name`, `company_logo_url`, `technician_name`, `already_rated`, `five_star_redirect`) stay backward-compatible.
- **Company contacts + booking_url.** `companies` already carries customer-facing `contact_phone` / `contact_email` (+ `name` / `logo_storage_key` used by `getPublicContext`). There is **NO `booking_url` column anywhere.** DECISION: `booking_url` = a **rate-me marketplace setting** (JSONB in `marketplace_installations.metadata.settings`, exactly like `google_review_url`) — **no DB migration for it.**
- **Settings whitelist.** `marketplaceService.js`: `SETTINGS_ENABLED_APP_KEYS = Set(['rely-leads','rate-me'])`; `validateRateMeSettingsInput` validates `google_review_url` and RETURNS `{google_review_url}`; `buildRateMeSettingsResponse` → `settings:{google_review_url}`; `updateAppSettings` REPLACES the whole settings blob (`marketplaceQueries.setInstallationSettings`) — so any new key MUST be parsed AND returned by the validator or PUT wipes it.
- **Send-link seams.** SMS: `conversationsService.sendMessage(conversationId,{body,author:'agent'})` + `getOrCreateConversation(customerE164, proxyE164, companyId)` + `resolveCompanyProxyE164(companyId)` (`messagingHelper.js`); exact reusable, wallet-gated pattern = `backend/src/routes/jobs.js` L831-867 (On-the-way notify, `WALLET_BLOCKED`/`SMS_FAILED`). Email: `emailService.sendEmail(companyId,{to,subject,body,textBody,…})` (throws if mailbox disconnected). Copy: return the `/r/:token` URL from mint; FE copies to clipboard.
- **Mint + public shapes (extend, don't fork).** `rateMeService.mintToken(companyId,{jobId,techId,techName}) → {token,url}`; `getPublicContext(token,hostCompanyId)`; `submitRating(token,{stars,feedback},hostCompanyId)`; `googleReviewUrl(metadata)`. `backend/src/routes/public-rate.js`: `RATE_TOKEN_RE=/^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{22,64}$/`, GET `/rate/:token` (60/min), POST `/rate/:token/rating` (10/min). `POST /apps/rate-me/tokens → mintToken` in `backend/src/routes/marketplace.js`. `middleware/rateHostGate.js` allowlist already covers `/api/public/rate/…` (beacon needs no new prefix; `/r/` stays).
- **Job-card home.** `frontend/src/components/jobs/JobDetailPanel.tsx` → left column `JobOpsSection` (in `JobStatusTags.tsx`, `JOB-ACTIONS-SLIM-001` band) is the home for the Rate Me status block + Send-link action. Modal precedent = `OnTheWayModal.tsx`; data via `useJobDetail.ts`.
- **Migration numbering.** Next free = **178** (highest is 177_rate_me). Parallel sessions may claim it — RE-CHECK vs origin/master at push and renumber both ends if taken. New migration is additive/idempotent, NOT boot-registered (applied via psql at deploy, same as 177).
- **Visual source of truth (owner-approved mockup, 7 client screens + Job-card block):** `scratchpad/rate-me-screens.html` (RM2 context pack). This spec formalizes that mockup.

### Пользовательские сценарии (use cases)

- **US-RM2-1 (customer, happy path).** Sarah opens the tokenized link right after Alex leaves → a mobile page greeting "Hi Sarah," with "How did Alex do?" and "Refrigerator repair · Friday, Jul 12", five gold stars → taps **5★** → rating records → a Google-helper screen ("Wonderful — thank you", prompt chips, violet "Write my Google review") → the button fires a click beacon and opens the company's Google review in a **new tab**; behind it our happy thank-you "You're the best, Sarah." stays visible with a quiet "Book your next visit" link + contacts.
- **US-RM2-2 (customer, recovery path).** Sarah taps **3★** → no auto-post; a private feedback screen ("Thanks for being straight with us", textarea + gentle topic chips + "Private — only ABC Homes sees this") → "Send to the team" posts stars+feedback → "Thank you — we hear you. A manager will reach out" with talk-now contacts and NO rebooking button.
- **US-RM2-3 (customer, already rated / expired).** Re-opening a rated link → "You've already rated this visit." + a warm rebooking block (violet **Book Visit** + contacts). An EXPIRED-but-recognized link → a soft "This link has expired." with the same rebooking block. A genuinely unknown/foreign token → the plain 001 "link no longer available" (no company data).
- **US-RM2-4 (dispatcher, send a link from the job).** A dispatcher opens a job's card, sees the "Rate Me" block, taps **Send rating link**, picks **SMS**, **Email**, or **Copy link** → the token is minted for (company, job, technician) and delivered; `sent_at`/`sent_via` stamp; the block then shows "Rating link sent · SMS to (617)…".
- **US-RM2-5 (dispatcher, watch attribution).** After the customer acts, the same Job-card block fills in the timeline: **sent → opened → rated (★N) → opened Google review**, every step tied to the exact `job_id` — "we know exactly which job the review came from."
- **US-RM2-6 (owner, configure rebooking).** The owner opens Rate Me app settings and sets **Booking URL** (`https://…`) alongside the Google review link → the customer screens' "Book Visit" / "Book your next visit" now point at it; leaving it blank simply hides those affordances (no dead buttons).
- **US-RM2-7 (isolation probe).** A dispatcher of company A cannot send a link on, or read the rate status of, company B's job (404/empty). A token/beacon for company B opened on company A's host → uniform 404. The public context never leaks more than the first name.

### Функциональные требования

- **FR-RM2-01 (personalization from the job — first name / service / date, PII-minimal) [OWNER].** Extend the public GET context to resolve, from the token's `job_id`: the customer FIRST name (`jobs.contact_id → contacts.first_name`; fallback = first whitespace token of `jobs.customer_name`; if neither → omit the name, greet generically "Hi there,"), the service label (`jobs.service_name`), and the visit date (`jobs.start_date`, formatted in the COMPANY timezone, e.g. "Friday, Jul 12"). The page greets "Hi {first}," and shows "{service} · {date}" under "How did {tech} do?". **PII MINIMAL — ONLY the first name may leave the public context; never last name, never the customer's phone/email, never ids, never another company's data** [OWNER]. Missing `service_name`/`start_date` degrade gracefully (omit the missing part; never render "—"). Additive to 001's fields. **Guard: SAB-CONTEXT-PII-LEAK.**
- **FR-RM2-02 (per-company branding + contacts + booking-URL — never hardcoded).** Branding (company name + logo), contact `tel:`/`mailto:` (`companies.contact_phone` / `contact_email`), and the rebooking `booking_url` are ALL per-company, resolved server-side from the token's company; NOTHING is hardcoded (no "ABC Homes", no mockup phone). `booking_url` comes from the rate-me setting (FR-RM2-19); phone/email from `companies`. Any value not configured is omitted on the page (no empty rows, no dead buttons) — mirrors 001's Google-link-missing fallback.
- **FR-RM2-03 (Screen 1 — personalized invitation).** Company logo (round, only if `company_logo_url`; `onError` hides the img — 001 NFR-8) + company-name eyebrow; greeting "Hi {first},"; headline "How did {technician_name || 'our technician'} do?"; subline "{service} · {date}"; one row of **five gold stars** (empty = neutral gray) with ≥44px hit targets; hint "Tap a star to rate". Single focus: the stars. No chrome, no "Blanc".
- **FR-RM2-04 (Screen 2 — 5★ Google-review helper).** On 5★ the rating records FIRST (001 POST contract), then this screen shows a small gold-star row + "Wonderful — thank you." + a humane ask ("A quick word on Google means a lot to a small local crew like ours. It takes about a minute.") + a prompt block "Not sure what to mention?" with chips **Punctuality · Clear explanation · Tidy work · Fair price · Friendliness** + fine print "Just prompts — your own words matter most." + violet primary **"Write my Google review"** (fires the click beacon then opens the company Google link in a NEW TAB — FR-RM2-10/15) + a quiet "Maybe another time" that drops to Screen 3. Shown ONLY when `google_review_url` is configured; otherwise 5★ goes straight to Screen 3 (001 fallback preserved).
- **FR-RM2-05 (Screen 3 — happy thank-you).** Centered gold-star mark + "You're the best, {first}." + a warm line + technician signature ("— {tech} & the {company} crew") + a **QUIET violet text link** "Book your next visit →" (to `booking_url`, NOT a filled button — tone) + contacts (`tel:`/`mailto:`). Happy terminal state, reached after the Google new-tab or "Maybe another time".
- **FR-RM2-06 (Screen 4 — 1–4★ private feedback).** On 1–4★ (NO auto-POST): a small gold-star row reflecting the pick (re-selectable until Send) + "Thanks for being straight with us." + "Tell us what missed the mark — this goes to our team, and won't be posted publicly." + a **textarea** ("What could we have done better?") + gentle topic chips **Timing · Communication · The repair · Pricing** + a privacy plaque "Private — only {company} sees this" + violet primary **"Send to the team"**. Submit posts rating+feedback (feedback optional/skippable) → Screen 5. **No Google, nothing public.**
- **FR-RM2-07 (Screen 5 — feedback thank-you).** Centered green check + "Thank you — we hear you." + "A manager from {company} will reach out to make this right." + "Prefer to talk now?" with `tel:`/`mailto:` contacts. **NO rebooking button** — selling a new visit to an unhappy customer is the wrong tone [OWNER]. Feedback terminal state.
- **FR-RM2-08 (Screen 6 — already-rated → rebooking).** When the token is already rated (GET `already_rated` OR POST replay `already_recorded` — 001 idempotency): violet check + "You've already rated this visit." + "Thanks again, {first} — it means a lot to {tech} and the team." + a rebooking block "Need help again? / Book your next service anytime" + violet **"Book Visit"** (→ `booking_url`) + contacts. No star picker. Turns a dead end into a warm rebooking lead.
- **FR-RM2-09 (Screen 7 — expired → rebooking; truly-invalid stays generic).** An EXPIRED but recognized token (valid token past `expires_at`) → a soft screen (NOT a raw 404): clock mark + "This link has expired." + "Rating links stay active for a while after your visit." + the SAME rebooking block as Screen 6 (violet "Book Visit" + contacts), using THAT token's company. **BUT unknown / malformed / foreign-host / app-disconnected tokens KEEP 001's uniform generic "This link is no longer available." with NO company branding, booking, or contacts** — revealing company data for a token we don't own would break 001's anti-enumeration + host-isolation contract. The rebooking block is shown for EXPIRED (company known) only. (See OPEN QUESTIONS FOR OWNER.)
- **FR-RM2-10 (threshold logic — 5★→Google new-tab, 1–4★→feedback) [OWNER].** Threshold is `stars === 5` ONLY, NOT configurable. 5★ → record, then open the company `google_review_url` in a **NEW browser tab** via `window.open` AFTER firing the click beacon (FR-RM2-15) — **never `location.replace`/same-tab**, because our thank-you (Screen 3) must stay visible behind the new tab. 1–4★ → private feedback (Screen 4) → feedback thank-you (Screen 5). If `google_review_url` is unset, 5★ still records and lands on Screen 3 (no dead end). **Guard: SAB-GOOGLE-SAME-TAB.**
- **FR-RM2-11 (chips are prompts, not text generators) [OWNER].** On BOTH the 5★ helper (Screen 2) and the feedback screen (Screen 4), the chips/bubbles are **thought-direction prompts ONLY**. Tapping a chip inserts NOTHING into the textarea and generates no review/feedback text (pre-writing the customer's words reads as coercion). The 5★ chips carry the fine print "Just prompts — your own words matter most." **Guard: SAB-BUBBLE-INSERTS-TEXT** (RED if a chip mutates the textarea value).
- **FR-RM2-12 (rebooking + contacts — placement rules) [OWNER].** Affordance intensity is tone-matched: **filled violet "Book Visit"** on already-rated (Screen 6) + expired (Screen 7); a **quiet violet text link** "Book your next visit →" on the happy thank-you (Screen 3); **NO rebooking** on the feedback thank-you (Screen 5). Contacts (`tel:` company phone + `mailto:` company email) appear on Screens 3, 5, 6, 7. Screens 1, 2, 4 carry no contacts/rebooking (focus). Every booking/contact value is per-company and omitted when unconfigured.
- **FR-RM2-13 (gold stars, violet single-action, Albusto v2) [OWNER].** Rating stars = **classic gold** (filled ≈ `#E0A72C`, empty neutral gray ≈ `#D2D2D0`) — the sole exception to the one-accent rule (gold = rating semantics). Every OTHER action (primary buttons + text links: "Write my Google review", "Send to the team", "Book Visit", "Book your next visit") uses the single violet accent `--blanc-accent #7F42E1` (`--blanc-accent-soft #E7DBFD` for soft marks/plaques). Palette strictly **Albusto v2** (`frontend/src/styles/design-system.css`, `--blanc-*`: neutral `#F1F1F0` canvas, white surfaces, ink `#191919/#6E6E6E/#8A8A8A`, hairline `rgba(25,25,25,.08)`, Manrope headings + IBM Plex Sans body, radii 10/16/22/28). **The string "Blanc" NEVER renders in UI.**
- **FR-RM2-14 (attribution schema — Migration 179, additive) [OWNER].** Migration **178** (re-check the free number vs origin/master at push; renumber if taken) ALTERs `rate_tokens` ADD (all nullable): `opened_at TIMESTAMPTZ`, `google_click_at TIMESTAMPTZ`, `sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ`, `sent_via TEXT`. **No `booking_url` column** (that is a JSONB setting — FR-RM2-19). Additive, idempotent, rollback-safe; NOT boot-registered (applied via psql at deploy, same as 177). `sent_at`/`sent_via` are single-valued → **most-recent-send wins** (matches the single "Rating link sent · {via}" step on the Job card).
- **FR-RM2-15 (event stamping — opened_at on GET, click beacon POST).** `opened_at` is stamped on the FIRST public GET context for the token (do NOT overwrite on later GETs). Add a public, rate-limited, host-bound, **idempotent** `POST /api/public/rate/:token/click` beacon that stamps `google_click_at` (first-click wins) and returns a minimal 200; the client fires it JUST BEFORE `window.open` on 5★. The beacon derives company/job from the token ONLY (never the body), is covered by the existing `rateHostGate` allowlist (no new public prefix), and — like every 001 public route — returns uniform 404 for unknown/foreign/malformed tokens. **Guards: SAB-GOOGLE-SAME-TAB, SAB-ATTRIBUTION-WRONG-JOB.**
- **FR-RM2-16 (Job-card "Rate Me" status block — attribution surfaced on the job).** On the Job detail panel (left column `JobOpsSection`, JOB-ACTIONS-SLIM band) a "Rate Me" block renders the token lifecycle for THIS job as a timeline: **Rating link sent** ({sent_at} · {sent_via}) → **Opened** ({opened_at}) → **Rated** (★N + rating created_at) → **Opened Google review** ({google_click_at}) — each step present only when its timestamp exists. Every event and the rating are tied to `rate_tokens.job_id` (schema 177). If no token exists for the job yet, the block shows only the "Send rating link" action (FR-RM2-18). **Guard: SAB-ATTRIBUTION-WRONG-JOB.**
- **FR-RM2-17 (job-rate-status GET by job_id — authenticated, tenant-scoped).** A NEW authenticated endpoint returns the rate status for a given `job_id` (token existence, `sent_at`/`sent_via`, `opened_at`, rating stars + created_at, `google_click_at`) to feed FR-RM2-16. Company-scoped by `req.companyFilter.company_id` (NEVER `req.companyId`); a job of another company → 404/empty. Mounted under the authenticated marketplace/jobs surface; exact permission gate = Architect (jobs-scoped vs `tenant.integrations.manage`). **Guard: SAB-SENDLINK-CROSS-TENANT.**
- **FR-RM2-18 (Send rating link from the Job card — SMS / Email / Copy) [OWNER].** An authenticated dispatcher action on the Job card mints (or reuses/extends) a token for (company, job, technician) via the existing `rateMeService.mintToken` / `POST /apps/rate-me/tokens` seam and delivers the `/r/:token` link three ways: **SMS** (the `conversationsService`/`messagingHelper` seam — wallet-gated, the `jobs.js` On-the-way pattern), **Email** (`emailService.sendEmail` — errors if the mailbox is disconnected), or **Copy link** (returns the URL; FE copies to clipboard). On send, stamp `sent_at`/`sent_via`. SMS requires a customer phone and Email a customer email (from the job's contact); when a channel's recipient is missing, that channel is disabled with an honest reason (no silent failure). Everything company-scoped; sending on another company's job is impossible. **Guard: SAB-SENDLINK-CROSS-TENANT.**
- **FR-RM2-19 (booking_url — a rate-me marketplace setting) [OWNER].** Add `booking_url` to the rate-me app settings stored in `marketplace_installations.metadata.settings` (JSONB, alongside `google_review_url` — NO DB column). Extend `validateRateMeSettingsInput` to ALSO parse and **RETURN** `booking_url` (nullable; else string, `https:` scheme, ≤500 chars) and surface it in `buildRateMeSettingsResponse.settings`; add a `bookingUrl(metadata)` reader in `rateMeService` mirroring `googleReviewUrl`. **CRITICAL: because PUT replaces `metadata.settings` wholesale, the validator MUST keep returning `google_review_url` too — dropping it wipes the existing Google link.** Company phone/email stay in `companies` (already tenant-scoped), not in this setting.

### Нефункциональные требования

- **NFR-RM2-1 (additive to deployed 001).** Every change is additive on the live 001 infra; the public GET context stays backward-compatible (new fields added, existing fields unchanged); 001's isolation, uniform-404 quintet, replay-idempotency (`rate_token_id UNIQUE`), `google_review_url`, and rely-leads settings behavior are all preserved. No 001 route contract breaks.
- **NFR-RM2-2 (PII minimalism).** Only the customer first name leaves the public context; no last name, no customer phone/email, no ids, no other company's data. New public fields are a hard whitelist (first_name, service label, formatted date, company contacts, booking-URL, plus 001's existing fields). **SAB-CONTEXT-PII-LEAK** = RED if the context returns extra PII or cross-company data.
- **NFR-RM2-3 (public route hardening).** GET context, POST rating, and POST click beacon remain unauthenticated but rate-limited per-IP (001 limiter precedent), token-format-guarded before any DB read, host-bound (foreign token/host → uniform 404), and derive company/job/tech from the token ONLY. The beacon is idempotent (first-click wins). No enumeration surface added.
- **NFR-RM2-4 (tenant isolation on authenticated surfaces).** Send-link and job-rate-status endpoints are company-scoped via `req.companyFilter.company_id` (NEVER `req.companyId`); operating on another company's job/token → 404/empty. **SAB-SENDLINK-CROSS-TENANT** = RED if either works on a foreign job.
- **NFR-RM2-5 (attribution correctness).** Every stamped event (opened / click / sent) and every rating attaches to the correct `job_id`/token; no cross-job or cross-token bleed. **SAB-ATTRIBUTION-WRONG-JOB** = RED if events/rating land on the wrong job.
- **NFR-RM2-6 (5★ new-tab).** 5★ uses `window.open` + a preceding beacon, never `location.replace`/same-tab. **SAB-GOOGLE-SAME-TAB** = RED if same-tab.
- **NFR-RM2-7 (chips inert).** Chips never mutate the textarea on either screen. **SAB-BUBBLE-INSERTS-TEXT** = RED if a chip inserts text.
- **NFR-RM2-8 (palette & wording).** Albusto v2 strictly; violet single action + gold stars only; "Blanc" never in UI; theme-aware light/dark via the design-system tokens.
- **NFR-RM2-9 (fail behavior).** Logo presign failure → name-only render (001 precedent); beacon failure must NOT block the Google new-tab; SMS is wallet-gated (`WALLET_BLOCKED`/`SMS_FAILED` honest errors); Email errors if the mailbox is disconnected (honest error, no crash); unconfigured booking/contacts/Google → the affordance is simply omitted (no dead links).
- **NFR-RM2-10 (settings integrity).** `booking_url` validation (nullable / `https:` / ≤500) and the replace-on-PUT invariant that `google_review_url` survives; rely-leads settings GET/PUT stay byte-identical.
- **NFR-RM2-11 (build + protected files).** FE build mandatory (`cd frontend && npm run build`). Protected/untouched: `src/server.js` (only a minimal flagged mount if a new public route is unavoidable, +N/-0), `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`, `frontend/src/hooks/useRealtimeEvents.ts`. `backend/db/` changes only via Migration 179.

### Именованные sabotage-контроли (обязательны — каждый RED при снятии guard, green при возврате)

- **SAB-BUBBLE-INSERTS-TEXT** — a prompt chip mutates the feedback/review textarea (FR-RM2-11).
- **SAB-CONTEXT-PII-LEAK** — the public context returns extra PII or another company's data (FR-RM2-01 / NFR-RM2-2).
- **SAB-GOOGLE-SAME-TAB** — 5★ uses `location.replace`/same-tab instead of new-tab + beacon (FR-RM2-10/15).
- **SAB-SENDLINK-CROSS-TENANT** — send-link or job-rate-status works on a job of another company (FR-RM2-17/18).
- **SAB-ATTRIBUTION-WRONG-JOB** — an event or rating attaches to the wrong `job_id` (FR-RM2-15/16).

### Open items for the Architect

- **AR1 — send-link gate + mount.** Exact permission for the dispatcher send (jobs-scoped vs `tenant.integrations.manage`) and where the send-link + job-rate-status endpoints mount (inside `/api/marketplace` vs a jobs-scoped route).
- **AR2 — beacon transport + sequencing.** `fetch(..., {keepalive:true})` vs `navigator.sendBeacon`, and how `window.open` is sequenced after it so a slow/failed beacon never blocks the new tab (NFR-RM2-9). Popup-blocker note: `window.open` must fire in the click handler.
- **AR3 — token reuse vs re-mint** on a repeat "Send rating link" for the same job, and how `sent_at`/`sent_via` update (most-recent-send wins per FR-RM2-14).
- **AR4 — getPublicContext query + timezone.** The `LEFT JOIN jobs + contacts` shape and the source of the company timezone used to format `start_date`.
- **AR5 — RatePage rewrite structure.** Single page-state machine vs sub-views, preserving the `/r/:token` route + `PUBLIC_AUTH_PATHS` and importing ZERO CRM chrome (the PublicInvoicePayPage / 001 precedent).

### OPEN QUESTIONS FOR OWNER

- **Screen 7 "expired vs invalid" scope.** The mockup lumps "expired/invalid" into one rebooking screen showing the company's Book Visit + contacts, but 001's anti-enumeration + host-isolation contract forbids showing ANY company data for a token we don't own (unknown / malformed / foreign-host). This spec resolves it as: **EXPIRED (recognized token, company known) → humane rebooking screen with THAT company's Book Visit + contacts; UNKNOWN / MALFORMED / FOREIGN-HOST → the existing generic "link no longer available" with NO company branding/booking/contacts.** Please confirm this split is acceptable (i.e. truly-invalid links do NOT show a rebooking block).

### Out of scope (explicit)

- **Auto-send on job→Done** (and any automatic trigger) — later phase; nothing mints/sends automatically this phase. Send is a MANUAL dispatcher action.
- Referrals, rewards, coupons.
- Two-axis / multi-dimensional rating — single 1–5 star only.
- ABC-Homes Vercel switch or any change to their external site.
- Ratings analytics / dashboard / reporting UI — the Job-card block shows THIS job's lifecycle only, not aggregate analytics.
- Configurable happy threshold (stays 5★) [OWNER]; per-technician Google/booking links.
- New custom-domain work (001 owns domains); Zenbooker writes (tech/job data read-only from existing tables/JSONB).

### Потенциально вовлечённые модули (по architecture.md)

- **Backend:** `backend/src/services/rateMeService.js` (extend `getPublicContext`; add `bookingUrl` reader; send-link orchestration), `backend/src/db/rateMeQueries.js` (job+contact join in `getTokenContext`; stamp `opened_at`/`google_click_at`/`sent_at`/`sent_via`; job-rate-status query), `backend/src/routes/public-rate.js` (click beacon; `opened_at` on GET), `backend/src/routes/marketplace.js` (send-link endpoint + job-rate-status GET), `backend/src/services/marketplaceService.js` (`booking_url` in validate/response). SMS via `conversationsService` + `messagingHelper.js`; Email via `emailService.js`. Migration `backend/db/migrations/178_*.sql`.
- **Frontend:** `frontend/src/pages/RatePage.tsx` (rewrite → 7-screen flow), `frontend/src/components/jobs/JobDetailPanel.tsx` + `JobStatusTags.tsx` (Rate Me block + Send-link action), a NEW Send-link modal (`OnTheWayModal.tsx` precedent), `frontend/src/hooks/useJobDetail.ts` + jobs/marketplace api clients, the Rate Me settings dialog (`booking_url` field).
- **Reuse read-only:** `jobsService.rowToJob` (service_name / start_date / customer_name / contact_id), `contacts.first_name`, `companies` contact_phone/email + logo presign, technician display name.

### Затронутые интеграции

- **Twilio — YES (send-link SMS only)** — the existing conversations/messaging seam, wallet-gated; no new Twilio surface.
- **Gmail / Email — YES (send-link email only)** — existing `emailService`.
- **Google — redirect-only** (new-tab to the company's Google-review URL; no API).
- **Zenbooker / Front / Stripe / VAPI — none** (technician/job data read from existing CRM tables/JSONB; no ZB writes).
- **S3/object storage** — presigned company-logo reads (existing mechanism).

### Защищённые части кода (НЕЛЬЗЯ ломать)

- `src/server.js`, `frontend/src/lib/authedFetch.ts`, `frontend/src/hooks/useRealtimeEvents.ts` — untouched (server.js only a minimal flagged mount if a new public route is truly unavoidable, +N/-0).
- All 001 contracts: public GET context + POST rating shapes (extend ADDITIVELY, keep existing fields), the uniform-404 quintet, replay idempotency (`rate_token_id UNIQUE`), the host-gate, the `google_review_url` setting, and rely-leads settings GET/PUT — byte-identical behavior; migration-177 tables read/extended only.
- `companies` — read-only here (no new columns; `booking_url` lives in installation metadata).
- Marketplace install/disconnect + `marketplace_events` writes — extend, don't modify.
- `technician_profiles` / `jobs.assigned_techs` / `jobsService` shapes — read-only.
- FSM subsystem, leads/jobs flows, Pulse timeline, softphone — untouched.

## PULSE-PLAYER-001 — плавающий плеер записей звонков в Pulse (OB-13) (2026-07-19)

**Как владелец**, я слушаю записи звонков в Pulse и хочу нормальный плеер: полоса прогресса с перемоткой, нормальные размеры кнопок, скорость — при этом карточка звонка должна стать чище (кнопочный ряд уходит из неё в плавающий hover-бар поверх страницы). Плеер живёт только в Pulse: ушёл на другую страницу — звук остановился. Ничего лишнего: без download, waveform, запоминания скорости, глобального плеера. Seek по клику из транскрипта/entities обязан продолжать работать. Спека: `docs/specs/PULSE-PLAYER-001.md`.
